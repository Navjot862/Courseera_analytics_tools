72546,"awesome course, really i loved it",2
28264,not so long ago i decided that i no longer wanted to practice the art of graphic design hazily since i was self taught. i wanted to know everything about it and this course has been quite helpful. for once i can now speak fluently about the fundamentals of graphic design. thanks to the coursera team.,2
88673,"there was not the same application of programming skills as in the previous courses. also, this course started too late after the other courses and i lost a lot of momentum in completing coursework.",0
39249,"do not take this course - the guy who reads (not teaches) the course, justin-nicholas toytama is horrendous. he's too lazy to even type out the codes and has the world's most monotonous voice.he pauses often to read this notes and has 0 enthusiasm teaching this class. if this class is not part of the certificate specialization, i wouldn't even pay for this course. $64 gets you further with nick walter or rob percival's udemy course.",0
40049,interesting research with practical applications!,2
17601,"high level, but very informative.",2
90117,"this is just a poor sample of a course. very few material, low quality assignments and grading.",0
37523,this a great beginners course.each concept is explained clearly and precisely.,2
14384,"it is too easy as a ""university"" course. it is much more like a pratictioner course. the final exam is ridiculous, really too easy.it can be thought as a week course instead of a four week course.",0
550,so far the course is just a tutorial for using scratch and they're not teaching how to program that is the name of the course.,0
70276,"i respect the fact the lectures contain a lot of references to the outside world, e.g. goes beyond the academia.",2
38793,this is a great introduction to both the law associated with how a critical part of everyday life became what it is and the building blocks that i never knew were part of it! thank you randy for sharing your vast knowledge!,2
25236,missing course material about how calculating fact table size ans sparsity,1
20293,very boring. not many real life advices. mstly theory,0
15591,"the course information was great and the assignments were very helpful. what lost points for the course was not the content provided by wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques. for each assignment i had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more. there should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.",1
104276,i am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short... tehchnically there is about 1h of videos for the 4 weeks of this course and no real documentations to review.hence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion... a full review of one or two games would have been a great addition.,1
104874,"personally, i feel that the way of sharing and teaching was assuming everyone is an expert in this subject. this course need to be reviewed to make it more suitable to various groups of profession as not everyone has the same level of mathematics background.",0
93352,"i really do not like the r language, i think it is sloppy and inconsistent. this class did ok teaching the basics of r, but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of r code (a key part of writing code!), best practices for modularization and factoring, and so on. in other words, it teaches you how to write r code that kind of works, but does not teach you how to write good code in r.",1
73566,topics about supply & demand were interesting.rest was too much theoretical for me. i would have liked shorter presentations with more concrete examples.design of the presentations could be improved as well.,1
88760,great course!,2
10490,"i got understanding about the big data, cloud and cdn. it really help to go further studies in big data.",1
45078,fantastic course and highly recommended to anyone who struggles with taking in information.,2
45133,"an amazing unique course, reinforcing the skills required to be effective at learning new material.",2
5571,missing examples,2
56999,i have heard a lot about this course and just enrolled into it.it looks great.i will update the review with more details as i progress.,2
66787,i did not like the teacher but i did like the course material.,0
106358,great as usual,2
58172,"excellent course. covered many key machine learning concepts, was clear and easy to follow. great support from both staff and other students with questions.",2
101002,very good intro to project management.,2
34347,"some good material overall, but the notes are not correctly formatted, tests are not formatted that well, lessons are not that clearly structured",1
53954,"teaches you concepts of regression, basics to start of with machine learning. assignments could be slightly modified and applied to many real life problems. if one can find a real time project, and apply the concepts they learn from this course they can make total use of it.",2
68530,"excellent course, highly recommended. hands-on and really easy to follow. would love some more background / reading about the applied statistics though (since this is new to me).",2
14733,great course.,2
49547,not good- weak lecturer- repeats himself endlessly- waste of time,0
90735,final assignment was very unclear,2
5560,the answers to the test questions can be improved significantly. most of them can be both justified or refuted.,0
26266,a very nice course!,2
72372,the greatest course on finance ever!!!gautam is fantastic! he makes finance understandable and fun. i love his courses and his way of teaching! he seems to love the subject matter and shows that he is interested and cares about delivering the material to the students so that they start appreciating it too. there should be more teachers like him. top course! top professor!!!,2
77133,great intro course!,2
83113,"everything is good. i like course. but i had trouble with finding reason of some failed tests. it is very annoying when test fails, you lost some points but reason is unknown - if test failed for some particular reason it doesn't mean that that particular check or part of implementation is incorrect: reason can be in some other place not covered with test at all. hope more tests will be provided, and for each fail will be possible find particular incorrect function or even check in some function. full coverage by tests for each tasks can make course learning much more efficient.",2
90667,it's nice course but a little bit boring.,1
38839,"this is essentially important for professional peoples and its compose in such a great way, i am totally inspired and suggest to others must have a look.regardsaabid ali shahid",2
95651,i am currently following this course and i can say that i am really enjoying.,2
16786,"very comprehensive course on introduction to database. this is an advanced course so you should have some experience with dbs before taking it. the lecturer, mr. mannino, delivers a dry, straightforward teaching style. there are plenty of materials but unfortunately, there is little interaction in the forums from the teacher himself.",2
2378,interesting but really introductive,1
15411,great information! well organized.,2
27353,very basic and useful command line tools for genomic data analysis.,2
32286,"at the first time it was a very usefull course in terms of knowing how we can improve life quality of this population in particular, but, at the end the course it turned into another perspective that for me does not met all the objectives previously exposed",1
10139,"the concepts are explained very well. the only issue was the programming assignment, which could have been more descriptive. also, they could've given us the option of choosing a programming language.",1
97292,it is very handy for teachers ..,2
88270,i'm not able to submit my assignments,0
24891,"the project is too unguided, you can set an example by creating a sample website throughout the course.",1
6826,this is a brilliant course. the information is presented in a structured and clear manner. the assignments are very interesting and really test your logical thinking.i am looking forward to studying the second part.,2
21724,doesn't worth the effort. you learn the most by searching online tools each time you encounter a problem while solving a quiz problem or following the steps the instructor did.,0
94069,"the content of this course is excellent, and i've learned a tremendous amount. it would be a 5-star course if that were the only criterion.i've become discouraged about the lack of rigor in the quizzes. a standard practice for students in online courses, if a quiz can be taken more than once, is to take the quiz before studying the material. (this is a research-supported study technique; it focuses attention on key points in listening/reading.) i'm finding that the questions virtually give away the answers. on my trial-run attempt, before the videos, i score close to or above the passing level. because the multiple-response answers are immediately visible, a student could boost into the generous passing range on a second attempt just by seeing which boxes should have been checked or left unchecked. i can usually achieve a score of 100% on three attempts before seeing any of the material.questions could be more difficult by requiring more discerning application of the principles, or by requiring true recall (typing in rather than choosing the information in a multiple choice format). there are dozens of ways to make questions a more rigorous and authentic assessment of student knowledge; i'm sure you know and practice many of them in your face-to-face classes.the option to repeat the quiz fails as an assessment because the questions are repeated identically even after the incorrect answers have been indicated -- and in the multiple response questions, this means that the correct answers have also been shown. a person with no knowledge of the subject matter should be able to score 100% in a maximum of 4 attempts at the quiz, just by trying each answer on each question. thus the quiz is not any kind of assessment of actual knowledge.the assignments do require a demonstration of some ability, but the grading scheme is sufficiently generous that a person who follows the instructions minimally will earn enough points so that, in conjunction with quiz scores, they pass and receive the certificate for the course.this certificate program has high visibility in social media right now; it would be a shame for the certificate to devalue rapidly when it becomes clear to employers and students that the certificate does not, in fact, indicate that a person has passed any minimal threshold of knowledge or skill.it may be that the capstone project is graded quite rigorously, so that any slackers from the previous classes will not earn the certificate -- but that's a bit devious too.",1
59353,perfect!!,2
91430,"unforyunately all the information is rather basic, most of the knowledge provided is intuitively understandable. didn't learn anything new. probably the problem is that it really is super basic and may be useful for somebody who is doing 1-2 year of bachelor's.",0
37735,an interesting course to introduce the basic concepts of html. i had a background about html however i learned new things.,2
26379,"great instructor, great course. i learned a lot !",2
90642,"every time one hear if you are not getting an interview call then it means your resume writing skills are not excellent, you are not able to project your self, you are not able sell your self or you might be overqualified / under-qualified. if you ask them for help, 90% are not in a position to guide you, 9% would support you, provide some reasons, but you still you feel handicap. i am lucky to find my 1% who hold my hand and walked me through each stage , educated me with the explanation why to write like this way in 21st century.in my view it is the right time everyone must gain this skill of 21st century resume and cover letter writing . we need to overwrite now, the old traditional way of resume and cover letter writing.thanks to charles duquette and daniela c. wagner-loera for making this excellent course easy to understand.",2
6001,"this one of the best course, i am really appreciate offering such great course.",2
104108,"i had rated the course earlier but would like to amend my statement. by some uncanny chance, i have just managed to pass the final assignment on my fourth try, which means i have passed my course. i still believe my original observations are valid. thank you.",1
5993,"if you want to learn more about both theoretical and practical computer science, do this specialization. i'm completely sold on this specialization after one week. the instructors are extremely helpful and have a high level of clarity both in the videos, and on the forums. the language semi-agnosticism is excellent! the forums are active and friendly! you will hit the ground learning right away with this specialization!this course has so far motivated me immensely to delve further in to my software engineering education. i did not get a bachelor's degree in computer science, just an associate's. though i work in the industry, i wanted to do programming competitions and personal projects to make up for the lack of experience with the ideas and implementation of algorithms and their data structures.this course has jump-started my journey beyond my current abilities, and i believe it will do the same for you. if you're even remotely thinking you would be interested in taking these courses, do!",2
34649,"pros: really motivating!cons: not much real content even for a beginner, too short.",1
247,"rather robust material with strong focus on ""deceptive"" practice detection. a lot of ratio analyses, each with its own moniker which i found tedious. informative and confirmed that i don't have the ""accountant gene"".",2
14918,really poor quality of the material.,0
17520,"great, but easy",1
52127,"there is quality implicit in the approach taken, but in my opinion, this course is excessively short, having only 20-25 minutes of videos per week, what is very limiting. also there is no slides of the material covered what i find not adequate. to fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures, slides would be determinant. just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning.",0
104920,teaching material is fine. the professor's explanation is monotonic and he uses textual definitions rather than simple explanations,0
53533,excellent course for everyone. it gives the opportunity to gain deep knowledge of machine learning to everyone.,2
79692,"course is overwhelming. how can you put a 30 minute video for a class? can you divide it or make it simpler? tutor is not explaning, he only reads; he reads sort of teleprompter and that's it. boring. very disappointed. and this is not my first course in coursera. i feel i'm about to quit, and this is the second week...",0
76787,easy and good,2
41948,extremely interesting !!!,2
105297,i like professor glady's style of minimalism in lectures but stressing the end goal of the analytics. it was an interestingly presented and fairly engaging course. assignments could be more difficult to encourage deeper learning of the hands-on analytic crunching.,2
97824,this course was extremely helpful in getting the perspective and live examples of design thinking!,2
9134,explains what calculus is well,2
71674,excellent learning.,2
88231,great !,2
29992,"course has not been updated. wrong answers in quiz (eg week 3 quiz on progressivity), videos getting blocked at review question point, etc. i am checking out.",0
32744,"it is not an advanced course. however, you will grasp key concepts of sustainable development applied to cities with encouraging examples. totally recommended!",2
12531,"if there hadn't been so many hiccups with the videos and quizzes i would recommend this course. however, i lost a great deal of time viewing incomplete videos and trying to complete quizzes covering material that was not addressed or only partially addressed in the videos. then had to go back and review all the videos once they had been re-uploaded. it was a very frustrating experience. i lost momentum and even motivation and as a result am now behind with the assignments and quizzes.",0
36594,"grate course , with grate teacher. it's a unique opportunity",2
104676,"probably the best course, although a bit short in content. i learnt a lot from it, thank you!",2
30661,this course is very interesting and useful! totally recomended for those who would like to review basic rules and gain some knowledge ;),2
75496,awesome course! i learned the basic python easely. thanks,2
51139,this course was absolutely great. i learned a lot more than i thought i would.,2
82767,"really enjoyed this course. having had experience in functional reactive programming, the content wasn't overly in depth but it helped cement understanding of how functional patterns can be used in place of oo ones, as well as further the knowledge of scala gained in the first course.the content on streams and futures was particularly helpful for me.",2
51373,well planned and easy to understand curriculum. i was encouraged and motivated every step of the way.,2
82498,"i am kind of disappointed that you have to pay for the course before you can submit the solution to the problem set. however, that is not the main issue of this course, as i fully understand that the financial profit for the lecturer is very important. the main issue of this course is that the chaos in the symbol used in the second programming assignment, the lecturer cannot even main self-consistency in the symbol used. the statement of everything in both pa1 and pa2 is also very confusing.",0
4167,great,2
94002,very good for this ones who needs relevant information at this hr critical process and for those who need an update and also a refresh..very good!!,2
34723,"needs to be more concise.nick seems very passionate and trying to reach a broad audience, but overly explaining topics is creating ""lecture fatigue"" for me. for instance, every video starts with ""welcome back... this is why people like this... [meat of the video]... this is what we just talked about.... see you next time"". i really just need the [meat of the video] part. these videos are 5-10 minutes long each. they are very short and therefore i do not need an introduction/closeout for each individual one. the module overview and module recap videos are sufficient to serve that purpose.overall, i learned the basics and will probably take the next gis course because i like the coursera framework, but i think this particular course could be much more condensed.",0
43439,"one of the best courses i have ever taken. amazingly inspiring. it is truly systematic and integrated course that introduces how to learn more effectively and efficiently. really appreciated dr.barbara oakley, dr.terrence sejnowski, and all the team. thank you all.",2
39277,the information is well presented but painfully slow.,1
100096,a few helpful tips but most of the stuff seemed like common sense.,1
97003,"it's a good course to have a first approach to meta-analysis, not for a deep comprehension or for acquisition of advanced techniques about meta-analysis data menagement. i hope you will organize an advanced course about this issues. thank you!!",2
49934,i love the way this course is designed! it's a really wonderful breath of fresh air.scratch is a wonderful tool for understanding programming before jumping into courses in programming languages.,2
90832,thank you vijay sir for this wonderful lecture,2
82260,needs to pay for submit assignments,0
31076,"it was a great course, clear, complete, easy to understand and very helpful.",2
61369,very good course. my overall knwoledge about data analytics was very limited and the course gave me the essential any marketer must know. thank you so much for coursera!,2
73205,"there were some great lectures included in this course, but the emphasis on the content we were not receiving was a bit disheartening. i would have loved to view more of the controversial lectures that were referenced in the wrap-up.",1
28848,that was very informative and motivating course. i wish the quiz was not that detail oriented and hard..,1
99670,"overall the course was good, but the quiz assignments need work. when entering formula's there should be more clarity. formula's can be entered in many ways and even when right were often counted as wrong.",1
17379,too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment,0
101023,"great course! for a know-nothing person like myself, this course has given me an opportunity to understand one of the most interesting and detailed-oriented subjects to learn. definitely recommend!",2
51607,"major issues with the tests not accepting chinese or pinyin text which they failed to respond to, despite multiple complaints.",0
80426,ok course. nothing more,1
38774,"this is an exceptional course. the quality of the lectures – course content, lecturing approach, and audiovisual production – is top-notch.randy picker provides a fascinating, engaging look at various devices and platforms, starting with their history and then integrating legal considerations, particularly under antitrust and copyright law. he presents the material in an easily comprehensible and digestible way, and explores subjects (and objects) that are very relevant in the modern, connected, digitized, and (borrowing a word from this class) mediated world.i learned a lot, enjoyed the lectures, and can see the application of what i learned outside the virtual classroom. thank you!",2
3295,i would recommend the full specialization for anyone interested in web field,2
33822,too many mistakes in the math. i dropped after a week,0
10275,"the content was very useful. however, a little more detail could have been provided while explaining a few concepts. i am confident of using these frameworks in the future. however, before applying them i will have to visit the material again. thank you so much.",1
14947,"basically if you take this course you are paying money to create an account on a website and download some software (both of which you can do for free). the rest of it is a preview of the other courses in the series. the quiz questions don't correspond to the information on the slides. i successfully passed the course, but i didn't really learn anything. now i am debating on whether or not to continue to the r programming course after reading through the reviews of that course.",1
75390,"to a novice programmer, like me, python is the best programming language and this course is perfectly relevant.",2
42637,one of the best course i ever attended on coursera! very clear and useful. thank you!,2
32960,it was very helpful for the beginner in html5,2
65688,very informative and interesting!,2
39666,really an interesting class. i gained some really useful knowledge about how the internet works and i am anything but a computer person. great class!,2
49006,"ok introduction to material properties, but not rigorous (leaves out definitions, motivation and conclusions/consequences) and skips some things that come up on the quizzes. no worked examples.",0
34251,professor northcraft keeps you engaged even while remotely teaching! his stories and curriculum are great from start to finish. the 4 modules that are given provide real life scenarios and teamwork is utilized the whole way through. this course is a definite need for future leaders and managers.,2
4423,"complex concepts (e.g., regression), which cannot be taught in such a short course format (i know from extensive prior training), are taught here in an arcane way. i don't know how students without prior knowledge on these topics (e.g., regression, roc curve analysis) could possibly understand this when taught this way.course is also in an 'early draft' mode, with plenty of mistakes in the videos/slides. the course (and specialization) really tarnishes - instead of enhancing - this institution's outside image and reputation.really a deception; sorry i took this class and specialization, a complete waste of my time and money. the initial presentation was misleading (and i have found online many people sharing the same feeling).",0
92199,a clear explanation of the topic. very useful background on sql and intro to sqlite.,2
39990,"the course is really really great, the reason that i gave it 4 stars not 5 is only because the professor has been frequently promoting for his personal book!",2
90101,"could have been awesome course if it discussed some detailed approaches. only 3 panning approaches discussed in 4 weeks, thus disappointing.",0
104791,"kudos to caffo for using charts and examples to provide a lot of insight without using a lot of math. however, i would personally like the math to be presented, too (e.g., the 'off-center' t-distribution, etc.). this could be done is special sections of the book and lectures, as is done in the regression models class.",2
26722,"doesn't have to be that complicated with command prompt actions from the beginning of the course, that make the motivation drop very fast.",0
7855,it was a great course!,2
83662,very useful!,2
101796,very insightful and informative. i look forward to advancing with every course!,2
67092,"the course is an advanced one and not really suggested for a beginner who would want to understand basic concepts. also during the course, the teaching was fast and there was lot of content to understand. the practice programs contained lot of code which was confusing for a learner like me. hence, hoping that these shortcomings will be sorted out as and when the course profile is updated.",1
96554,poor teacher..,0
5486,"this course covers a good amount of bayesian statistics. however, the presentation/videos starting from week 2 really sucks. they change instructors for difference topics and obviously some instructors are not very good at explaining other than reading the material.the videos skipped many medium steps that are actually very crucial for understanding the concepts. and no suggested reading materials at all either. also the quiz are not very well designed either. for example, some quiz are much more simpler than the course material, which makes it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself. while some times it is the opposite.the first three courses in this specialization are very good, but somehow this course are way below the quality of the previous ones.",0
3843,"not a bad introduction, but if you already know a bit about programming you can get the same basics and learn more quickly with a book.",0
73926,this was a very basic course. i was expecting something more advanced. but all of what was taught was good and clear.,1
85914,i love this course. very specific. with tons of practical information. good examples.,2
69509,"i had loved this course, because they teach you a lot of in chinese and we can improve your language cultural.",1
65807,"the course lacks for the practice exersises. instead, the quizes are full of questions like ""present simple tense is used to write about a special study implemented by a well-known scientist. true or false"". the questions of this type are pointless. still, the videos sometimes contain useful information.",0
28983,because all of us owe it to ourselves to be a bit happier than we are now. i'm finding this class is allowing me to give myself permission to be happy. this is making a difference in my daily life. i laugh more often & louder.,2
21662,"the course was very interesting. it touched upon all currently employed techniques in good detail. the lab-based videos were the most interesting. however, the lectures were too long. it would be a brilliant course if the lectures were cut short and made to the point.",1
61859,"this course was not nearly as valuable to me as the first course in the series. it breezed through a bunch of different plot types without explaining in enough detail what they would be used for or when you should choose to use them. at the same time, it also didn't provide enough clear examples of how to do basic things in matplotlib, which seems to me to be a very non-intuitive thing with poor documentation. i found the first assignment to be very difficult.",0
12123,found a lot of the tools in this class to be helpful in my career.,2
25849,"top notch course. even in the first few weeks, i feel like i've learned a great deal, especially for the price.",2
24481,"very little useful information, more like pr for pwc",0
40353,"very interesting, but i was really hoping more. for example, the professor does not teah us directly, like all the other courses on coursera. it is only texts and archive videos.....youtube would have done the same. disappointed.",0
98130,"the course was great. what i had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the honors programming assignments. i never received any feedback from the ta's and when i submitted to meta support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help. i got a segmentation fault on assignment one which i never did get resolved. because of this, i was unable to get the honors status.",1
64330,"all of the courses lecture are great until it reaches week 5 where it's really hard to catch, the programming assignment doesn't give enough hints and lecture in this topic doesn't help much.",1
105943,very watered down,0
33122,"very good introductory course, love it",2
57739,"extremely practical course for begineers. i earlier worked half way through ""learning from data by caltech"" which was much more theoretical for my taste. i highly recommend this one for begineers. and do complete the assignments!",2
91610,amazing and useful course,2
93860,"difficult to follow if you are new to any type of programming. this is not a beginner's course. best to take this course after trying swirl, data camp, or code school.",0
41329,"it is overall an ok course. samiliarly as a programming intro class, imo, the quality, range from the project design and content originzation, is no where close to the iipp offered by rice. i do not enjoy this course as much as i did in iipp.if you are just interested in getting touch with programming, instead of learning java like i, go to take iipp.i think the first week should appear later, probably should be swapped with week 2 or even 3. the first week class was just super confusing without knowing the basic concept like vairable type declearation and the connection between different methods.good luck!!!",1
40094,really well organized and structured information,2
17753,a clear and concise training of data science. one example of data science project would help to understand better. thanks.,2
102064,"the teacher provides a thorough explanation of the se landscape. if you are just getting started in seo, you should take this course.",2
98623,turned out to be a course in financials rather than modeling. the whole specialization could have been designed to make better progress in modeling.,0
55312,"it's my first class to get into the machine learning world, i love it!!!!!!!!!!!",2
79212,interesting overview on the topic.,1
73160,"very repetitive with previous courses (especially week on competitive advantage), otherwise many concepts uses in a different way with different terms.",1
89904,awesome course!! professor boyd will guide you through the basics of python programming. what i liked the most is that he managed to pinpoint all the relevant aspects of python and programming and yet the difficulty is low enough to keep you motivated until the end.,2
78968,speed is very fast for a basic level student. the data explanation and correlation demonstrated is not clear.,0
4567,"don't know how to apply the statistics and excel formula in real world situation. besides, it becomes focus on approving statistics equation than teaching data analysis in excel",0

74985,"i wanted to get some basics of python, but was rather disappointed by this course. it is incredibly slow, i really don't understand who might need a whole lecture to get the concept of functions or so. probably, this course could work for children with low level of math and zero programming experience, but otherwise it is waste of your time. i added the third star just for the book which is good on its own.",1
74279,"it would be good if the course can include the worked solutions to the assignments, and solutions to all the examples at the end of the chapters in the textbook",2
11804,a very good introduction to clinical trail,2
76574,great course. extremely well-taught!,2
81531,"barbara is amazing, very easy to learn with her!",2
82139,light introduction using jquery and bootstrap as shortcuts.,1
98261,this course is very well structured and designed for marketing specialists.,2
39974,this course is a must. there is just no other course that can nurture your spiritual yearnings within the framework of science. take it. it's a wonderful course.,2
78918,"i enjoyed the rmd labs. i think they provide a great interactive hands on learning experience that video and paper assignments alone can not cover. the material covered in the labs is worthwhile as well, showing how to dissect that table into different cuts for investigation",2
57387,"this is a very good course, which do not require high level programming skill. it is very suitable for beginners. besides, this course is very comprehensive and introduce a lot in machine learning field.",2
104623,great course about meteor.js applications,2
79221,very helpful. thanks.,2
103503,this is the first course that will only let you grade the quiz if you purchase the course. highly disappointed...,0
18794,"this course is a pure advertisement for ibm products. i entered the course expecting to learn about raspberry pi and python and got nothing our of it! if you are really looking to learn about iot, check out a course called "" an introduction to programming iot"" by university of california, irvine. i am taking this course right now and already learning a ton! this course, on the other hand, is a total waste of time.",0
82174,"a very lightweight intro to html, css, javascript, jquery and a dash of boostrap. the instructors barely introduce the topics, and then point out that we don't need them, we can just ""google or yahoo"" for the information.if you just need a shove to get you moving down a path, this might be helpful, or if you are brand new to html, this would be a relatively painless way to check it out. i'm just not sure there is enough hand holding over the difficult bits for someone brand new to coding. the materials are pretty sparse and there is not much structure.all four weeks are available at the onset of the class and the entire class can be completed in a weekend.",0
68271,really good one,2
35696,the open my eye to see what going on around the globe in regards to environment and how to manage them.thanks guys!,2
2658,"great course, helped me to move from a basic user to intermediate in tableau",2
13811,probably one of the best moocs i have ever taken :),2
10466,the course was very basic and there was nothing new in the videos compared to the document(pdf) . instructor was only reading the slides.,1
22617,great course,2
21889,too difficult practical exercises with the theorical background given. i know that hackers skill should be used but it is too much assumption in the projects!!,0
22052,instructor reads lectures in monotonic voice. the lectures themselves are just a series of cases of some r functions usage with no basics of why you need to clean the data or real cases with complete examples how and where to get your data and what steps you can do to make it useful.the course has a lot of links for tutorials in r. that's a plus.,0
4228,"leve of difficulty was above my expectations. moved too fast. could have been more thorough in applying the content to examples similar to the quiz. seemed to stick to the bare minimum of what would be required before moving to the quiz. be transparent with future prospective students that this course absolutely requires knowledge of calculus, probability, and statistics.",1
106221,"too repetitive, and i do not want to submit a video of my self teaching.",0
44017,"very useful. explained how the brain - mind and memory - works, and showed techniques for learning more effectively. wish i'd known about this stuff while i actually went to high-school and college!",2
32287,maybe i was wrong but i expected more medical course with many practical examples and the course is sth like 'explore your creativity in the field and be prepared'.,0
6565,"the faculty of this course represent a wonderful assembly of knowledge and experience. but the course was not well organized, and the emphasis on fine teaching that i have found in most coursera courses was not present.",1
10468,"awesome... very helpful in building concepts in knowledge in big data,cloud computing and cdn.",2
11733,"i had a very poor experience being graded by peers. although the capstone project assignment itself is excellent, the peer grading rubric is not. i was not fairly graded, and i am sure of this 100%.",0
99675,1st 3 weeks were helpful but questions of the quiz were unclear & improvement is really necessary but still an ok course for basic learners.it could be much better,0
38662,"basing on the first videos, i would not recommend this course to anyone believing that ""you are expected have basic computer literacy skills, such as knowing how to send & receive emails and browse the web"".the lector is robotic, the slides look outdated, listener is bored after 10 min of watching. i definitely would not pay for this course.i will change the rate after i watch more videos, but this course is a big no-no for me.",0
15920,"a brilliant course! i could not expect it would be so interesting. not only the content, but the way it is presented by professor rolf strom-olsen was thrilling, funny, sometimes unexpected. it is really impressive how he made huge complicated ideas comprehensible for students, so that we could freely examine and play it during the class. highly recommend.",2
101564,"you will learn nothing from this. the teacher is useless and you only get peer-feedback. while i usually love peer feedback, i lost all interest so quickly.",0
99959,very disappointed that the assignments are not part of the f,0
87882,course is good but the assignment are too basic. i would appreciate if there could be tougher assignments may be not included in rating.,1
8788,"an mix of general tips on how to write well mixed with some corporate-specific information. broad overview, but i didn't really learn anything.",0
86802,this is a nice slow introduction to python web programming for those who have no experience or prior knowledge. otherwise it is not at all challenging.,1
74873,"awesome course! never thought i'd finish a programming class. most of them are boring and lose me after a few lectures with the overloaded info and codes. but this one is so interesting. love the way prof kept me interesting throughout. easy-to-follow, hands-on codes, quiz, and homework really helped to learn.highly recommended, and would love to continue :)",2
41724,this course let's you gain experience designing for different screen sizes. it's very useful because you feel the needs and difficulties of showing the right information according to the available space.,2
103895,"this is a well designed course that is clear in what it focuses on to give you a good foundation. that said, there is so much more to learn.make sure you look at the final project after each module to get an idea for all the opportunities to apply the optional materials. you can still pass without doing using the concepts in the optional sections but there is time to get even more out of the final project if you prepare and explore.",2
81574,"superficial treatment of the subject matter. presentation was awkward and slow, and at times condescending in tone. this whole course is equivalent to a 2 hour seminar on ""how to live more positively"" presented at local community centre. it is not university level learning - instead it seems glib and lacking in substance.",0
18691,too much short for a vast and challenging topic like digital manufacturing.,1
65961,"informative and entertaining! yes, in this course you can learn about memory and have fun watching movies.",2
52542,this course has high quality instruction a,2
14611,very basic,0
18142,very interesting and really well taught!,2
89933,it was an interesting first experience with python but it seemed a little bit to easy for me actually. i have been able to complete the hole course on one free day.,0
17584,"brian caffo's lectures were rambling and confusing, with excessive use of jargon without proper explanation. his graphs were overwhelming with information, and little effort was made to explain the graph. otherwise, the other lectures were very good, concise, and clear. thank you.",1
104811,very disappointing!!!!!!!too much emphasis on mathematical notations....where are the practical applications?lack of examples....it seemed more of a prose than a lecture....would not recommend to a beginner.period,0
76303,very well designed course. it has given me a good start to kick-off python learning.,2
87307,"took the first two courses which were fine but this one started off poorly and just got worse, unfortunately. i'm wondering if i can get my money back.",0
100003,presenter speaks too slow. still slower than i would like at 2.0x speed. not a lot of new information.,0
21474,good introduction to digital photography with some good tips. some chapters are a bit too long in my opinion.,2
78741,the best course for python,2
65334,course is very interesting to pool knowledge.,2
51575,"i can't believe i learnt that much!! thank very much for offering so much quality in your courses and let everyone to be part of it, even if someone can't afford the certificate. thank you!",2
96838,the course just maximizes the urge to do more despite the challenges in waking up at night to work on assignment....i love it.,2
68210,the only reason that i am giving 3 star is the design of the quizzes for each week. the readings are too long and the content of the quiz sometimes gets you frustrated!,1
65931,"i loved the way the course was given, with film examples.",2
10037,a very informative course that will definitely help you to excel in your professional field.,1
53134,"i like it very much!! is super objective, fast and specific.",2
14790,"by far to expansive for what you get. anyway, thanks for the hint about swirl.",0
12132,very good lessons.,2
65450,"i loved this course, it was extremely up to standard and beneficial. i wish it went longer. i felt it ended a bit too soon! still got a lot to learn and go into details. it could've used to go over annual reports and discuss them or go actually behind the scenes on case studies to better implement the things we're learning with concrete and elaborate examples. i highly recommend this course. thank you!",2
106704,"course was amazing. it deals with how to correctly understand visual illusions through empirical data collection. it does not delve into the anatomical aspects, or the cellular aspects, of vision. some drawbacks would be the lack of explanation on how to model or collect the data, which is probably too complicated to state in a online course anyway.",2
12020,"well paced, very informative, challenging enough.",2
50817,"very shallow coverage, doesnt have the scope to be an entire course!",0
24754,"as for information in course itself, it was interesting for me to enroll and to be part of the course.but i highly dislike that there was a feeling of that the lecturer is trying to remember any things right while the video goes. it is not a real class, it is a video and it could be done much more accurately. there were many many boring moments, while management itself is not a boring discipline, it is very interesting.anyway i am glad i participated in the course.",0
14734,pretty simple overview of data science tools,2
26689,bravo and thanks!,2
103297,"i liked the content that was presented. there was some really good advice, like the importance of being disciplined in sticking to the algorithm you have designed. unfortunately there was no detail at all about how to backtest, where to get data for backtesting, where to find research papers upon which to base an algorithm, etc. in other words, everything was kept at a very abstract level, and not enough detail was provided to actually do anything.",0
78011,"so far, i am really enjoying this class. i am so thankful for this free source. i have taken a few python classes, the the beginning was a review, however the instructor makes the course beginning very enjoyable to watch. thank you!",2
18610,last week was incredibly difficult.,0
90097,best course for getting an introduction of computational motion planning.,2
65808,the worst coursera course i have taken. total waste of time. the lectures are boring and have no real content. the supplementary materials are good though.,0
63362,"nothing new to learn here, this is very dull in contrast to other courses of this spec. i gave up watching the videos after a while and try to pass anyway. too bad this is part of this spec, i wish marco or matthew taught this course too. this course is very hard to follow and not interactive at all. it should take the students through examples, live examples the student can do too, and things the student builds from scratch. this does nothing like that.don't take this course if you aren't after the specialisation certificate. it's not worth the time and effort.too bad this spec includes this course, it shouldn't be here.",0
65795,"during this course, i learned so many tips for writing a good research paper in english.",2
11537,lots of theoretical information but very little practical information about what to do with people with autism spectrum disorder,0
29709,"it is a very good course. however, i must admit that is discouranging making the course because when you do the course free you do not have the opportunity to make all the excercises. despite that, it is very good.",2
93486,"the course lecture was ok, swirl was pretty good. the assignment was confusing and the instructions were not very clear.",1
19800,"the course material was interesting, but the total lack of support forces me to give it only one star. i left the following complaint in the general forum for this course 2 months ago. neither coursera, the instructor or any moderator ever responded. many people were not able to run the software supplied in the course because of bugs, but the solution was left to the student. i have taken good courses on line before, but this is not one of them.it seems that the dr. tucker balch and/or the moderators have totally abandoned this course, but coursera keeps offering it and collecting money.the neither instructor or nor the moderators have posted on the meet and greet forum.the instructor and/or moderators have answered no questions posted on any forum.the qstk (software) bugs have not been addressed by the instructor or the moderators. only students have answered these forum questions.""computational investing part ii is coming shortly."" that is what they said 3 years ago. further evidence of abandonment.",0
104346,it is what i was looking for!,2
96440,awful teacher,0
13493,to lock assignments for money is disgusting.,0
75004,very helpful~~thank you.,2
15482,the quizzes are not set up correctly and you get marked wrong when you put in the correct answers. it seems that the course was rushed and not properly tested before it accepted students. the content is good and that is why i gave it more than one star.,0
48026,this is probably one of the most useful courses i have taken on coursera. and the fact that it is on demand allows me to work when i have the time instead of rushing it since i am working full time.,2
98520,"i had done all the tasks in february-march - i don't remember exactly when, but i received my certificate in may. the course was interesting, but i needed the certificate for my application to university. now i'm so dissapointed.",0
43101,awesome course! i am excelling in all my classes because of these valuable techniques. great instructors too!,2
3403,"too long videos, you should make more short videos, instead of one boring long video. you speak too slow and that makes a 8 minutes video turns into 30 minutes video.",0
7244,"3.5+ star course. i hope by studying the following courses, contents of this course prove to be more practical.",1
40305,"i like the content of the course.however, there are some remarks i want to share.for one of the asssignments i have to create an accout on soundcloud. i never used it before and do not understand why i should leave somewhere my personal data if i do not plan to use this service in the future. i assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all.",1
95989,great tool and greatly structured,2
99586,"the slides are not at all helpful. unfortunately, this is a far less useful course than the companions in the specialization. the quizzes tend to be glitchy, and have a maddening propensity to have users type formulas,",0
78725,"i was expecting a more in depth, more rigorous course. more homework, at the very least. also, the first two weeks could have been condensed down to one.",1
87976,"too long, too diversified, too much usage of technical terms; heterogenous content.",0
9776,the excercises should be set up to be more comfortable.,0
1817,"if you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series i suggest you look elsewhere. i was able to complete the first course with ease, but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and does not tie in very well with the how excel is used. don't be fooled by how easy the first weeks assignment is for the second course of this specialization.**my initial rating for this course alone was 4 stars, but due to the lack of effort and information in the 2nd course of this specialization i have to give this 1 star as these courses are all tied together.",0
98716,"it is a poor course because is not properly designed for internationals. language is mainly french in slides and subtitle is not that helpful.instead of spending time outside to read the notes, it was better to prepare helpful slides for students to understand better what you are talking about.",0
70346,very good course. best explanations through good examples. if assignments were programming rather than objective it would have been much better.,2
93532,never used r until i took this course. this was a good course to start with and helped me dive into the world of r.,2
75650,the first 2 weeks become kind of boring and instead of motivating. rest is easy to understand but still covers only very basics.,2
41328,"the content was useful and i do feel a foundation is being set.the area where i think the course fell short is on the support we got from mentors or instructors in the forum, basically null - pun intended. there are some points where it's easy to fall into a rabbit hole, like i did. without support, a simple challenge supposed to take a few minutes can turn into hours, days.",1
40379,thank you,2
102670,"concise and full of interesting ideas - a great introduction to many topics that are worth exploring, and think through.",2
98481,"if you have done the data science specialization prior, this is a lot of review. it is good review though. if there were any skills that would be good to get repeat practice on, it would be these skills.",2
25007,"it give me a strong basic knowledge on character design, i enjoy every session on this course",2
7226,just about okay. wouldn't recommend to pay for this.,1
88566,explains a very good model which could be adopted and used to train relief workers in terms of providing psychological support in a case of a disaster. course is structured nicely and provide simulation videos to comprehend the material better.,2
11574,i had problems to understand better about asd (autism spectrum disorder) because my 3 year old daughter been diagnosed as autism spectrum disorder. the doctor explain yet i still couldn't clearly understand about after learning this course i clearly understand what is asd all about..,2
28850,such an amazing course about happiness :),2
6785,"wow, super challenging and interesting.loved it, now i understand the fundamental of computing alu, ram, rom and nand :)",2
98431,great course,2
4667,"great course, ta!",2
46904,"this is a very good course but i think it can be made better, if there are summary notes associated with the videos.",2
105956,great experience and good content,2
39859,i did not like this course. it is a course for those who are already involved into the topic not newbies. very general short and sloppy explanations and a lot of practical assignments for peer evaluation. i had a lot of experience in classical music but i was puzzled with what goes on in this course. after having completed some other jazz courses i realized that i had no chances to learn anything here since the theory is not explained sufficiently. the title of the course is misleading. it rather should be called a master class on jazz improvisation.,0
50953,dry principles without real life examples and exercises. you can passed the quiz by just reading online or have basic project management experience. disappointed.,0
93933,poor. very boring and dull presentation. hardly anything is explained very clearly. it would be far more profitable to simply study an appropriate textbook or online course notes.,0
2192,derived attribute was never conveyed in the videos. so kindly add up the concept of derived attribute.,2
46376,"very interesting course, with a lot of easy tricks.",2
90275,too much theory and projects didn't related with real life problems.,1
37282,"too easy, please do not repeat the same thing three times, it's just a waste of time and i'm not stupid. it's also too academic and should focus more on how to build real websites.on the bright side, it does give you some basics of html, css and javascript. instead of this course, i would much more recommend following ""html, css, and javascript for web developers"" by yaakov chaikin from john hopkins university, it taught me good foundations + tricks and good practices for professional web front end developers.",1
103744,this is only theory related to the evolution of the systems. how their features change over the time.i personally think that it is useless because you really do not learn anything.,0
94282,"too general no depth, not recommended for science or engineering degree holders",0
52132,"some quick and interesting input; kind of basic and superficial, though.",1
37842,it's a well designed course and you can do homework with what you just learn. all of these knowledge give your a basic concept of html + css＋javascript.,2
29690,it's a good course and it has a great structure !,2
39099,good course for beginners to get used to the terms of javascript and basic working.unfortunately it's not as good as the html and css courses in this specialization. the basics are touched upon but i don't feel confident enough to start javascript coding on my own yet. more explanation of the concepts is needed as some things are really difficult to understand and you have to search outside the course to understand them.,1
50833,"nice introduction, although i don't see any reason to call this ""a course"", if it's less than 2 hours total (at least it felt that way) while we have to listen to an intro every 5 minutes of it.would've rated it 2 stars based on the content, but the level of presentation was really good and i appreciate the effort.",1
10452,not enough detailed.,1
86166,several mistakes on the translations of the exams,1
103691,this is probably one of the worst courses i've taken in coursera.just an enumeration of what's on each version of the operative systems and few more information.,0
104933,"the subject is interesting, but the explanations are a little confusing. may need more diverse real-life examples to relate.",1
97582,"very compelling arguments and facts. i was looking for something to do and always enjoy broadening knowledge.the content was heavy enough to be meaningful, but light enough to be enjoyable. i enjoyed the discussion forums. i will be continuing the series.",2
85748,"it's a shame that almost all courses are to be paid for nowadays. for one, i am not paying for it, many will follow...",0
27995,thats a good course for beginers.in my opinion should be more illustrative with more real and nice examples.,1
40346,"a good introduction to the history of spaceflight, was great to learn more about how the mankind could to start exploring the space.",2
49780,simple course to gain knowledge on iot and embedded system.,2
79241,"concise but too concise i feel. maybe it's meant for more foundation/beginner level ? else, need more details. not just overview.and, need more involvement/engagement from students, need multiple (randomized per attempt) questions in quizzes, need participation from course producers/tas for questions and clarifications needed by students (in discussion forums).",1
103973,quality and length of material is mediocre.,0
33234,an excellent course for all those beginners who really want to get their fundamentals straight. professor coleen is an amazing teacher who is really passionate about what she is doing.,2
47588,taking this course has changed my entire outlook on learning. i found this course very interesting and my learning abilities and habits has improve a lot since taking thins course. thank you for teaching me how to learn!,2
38998,great course to me.,2
105825,great course. it´s change my mind about sustanaibility,2
73137,really informative. equations were a bit difficult to understand. i felt that there was a bias towards anthropic principle.,1
82818,"course material was not difficult, but the homeworks weren't much correlated with it. if you attend other it online courses you will notice that this one is a little old fashioned. i was also more interested in real-life usages than how it should be implemented. regardless the cons course was informative and somehow useful.",2
82747,i was expecting more from it.,1
24908,"i have some html/css background. i listened to the first module and then part of the second module. for a intro level course to get a site up and running using word press, i feel like it is missing some key information. as a non-beginner i am finding this course frustrating and not likely to continue. there are definitely better courses out there.",0
7252,in this specialization it are all good documented wel explained courses,2
104270,"short, simplistic. could be done in a week. very much a beginner's course for those who have not mindfully observed the game worlds in which they play. the student may come away with a few new ideas and the greatest value is in having peers review the homework assignments. worth the time, if you quickly breeze through it.",1
27445,a great beginner level course to get a quick view of stuff game theory deals with.,2
42502,"this was amazing. a lot of practice, a lot of practical ideas. at fist i was a bit prejudices to the lecturers but in a few days i liked them very much. i use this ""focused-diffuse thinking"" approach a lot lately to remember the things i was trying to remember. also i like additional interviews.",2
18586,"very very basic course. learned about html ,css in initial classes. then it was completely javascript. but there was no details about how to use javascript for web programming. projects and quizzes are kind of ok difficulty.i will recommend this course for the people who are not aware of programming.",0
106279,"annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until after enrolling. this course is in c++, so if you're not a c++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this.",1
38697,great!!,2
93729,"this was a good introduction to r programming. the assignments were very challenging, and it didn't always seem like the lessons properly prepared you for them, but i guess they just required some ""hacking"" skills (the initiative to find your own answers, on google, stackoverflow, etc.). the step-by-step optional swirl r assignments were very useful.",2
61225,it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine,1
62030,"really enjoyed following this course, which has capture my attention from day 1. i learned a lot. congratulations for putting together such a well balanced course.",2
21228,"course feels somewhat abandoned by instructors. content is okay, but can't help the feeling that it's basically a cash cow - students would benefit a lot if instructors were move involved.",1
4551,"great idea. unfortunately, the course is young and there were too many bugs to get past week 2. hopefully these will be finished my next session",0
84788,"this was a great course, and dr. chuck's dedication to teaching python is amazing. i went through the ""programming for everybody (python)"" course and as stated in the description, this course is equivalent to the second half of the first course. i missed that detail and would have otherwise just skipped right to the third course (using python to access web data."" otherwise, it's a great course.",2
25218,"not enough implication from the instructors in the course. students are left alone with the material, without any answers to there questions on the course.peer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the students.that's quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that.",0
26190,"really ice course, the videos are ease to follow, and the instructor is really active in the forums (which is awesome)",2
104980,"the class needs to be more accessible especially for non statisticians, i learned more from khan academy which got me through this class than the class itself",0
74431,a wonderful course design for people who has zero background on programming. highly recommend!,2
48813,"good and fresh insight on leadership, teamwork and negotiation",2
4398,"this course is definitely not for beginners. you must have intermediate to advanced knowledge of statistics and math. i had to resort to google and khan academy extensively just to grasp the concepts in this course. this course also does not teach you everything about excel, let alone master it. you just refer to pre made excel sheets for quizzes. thats it. good luck figuring those out.",0
16869,"interesting to try r hands on. could have made more definitive statements on the usefulness of each test (there was lots of 'you could have a look at this analysis, or this one, or this one' without covering why each one would be particularly good for this case). some of the later exercises also made quite of a leap in terms of what you were expected to know about r syntax, although the follow up answers were good if you didn't understand what was expected.",1
32992,it is very boring course no coding just watching a lady talking and talking and talking it is really very boring to do that,0
104977,"in debth enough to go through concepts slowly, but high level enough to keep them applicable to different problem settings",2

85603,"horrific. if i could rate this zero i would. the instructor will give you a one sentence explanation and definition for a term (literally, i downloaded the transcripts to help with my notes and assignments) and then say, ""now that we learned x..."" and fly right into the next term. worse, many of the sentences don't even make sense and completely incoherrant, even in the written transcript. i am having to go out and find additional textbooks to research the basic definitions of what is required to pass the course. there is even less explanation of real-world applications, examples, and demonstration. it is almost as though she tried to memorize a sheet of definitions and repeated them without the use of her notes. this results in a highly monotonous monologue with awkward gestures and little actual content. i was planning on going for the pr for digital media certification, but i can't handle another course like this. it's a waste of time and money.",0
16725,"i found the content was great but the style of lectures were a bit too robotic and not conversational. this didn't help the learning process. also, the course admin might consider explaining 'on' 'and' 'where' 'timestamp', 'datediff' more than what was provided.",1

39307,very constructive and helpful,2

81845,very good! very comprehensive!,2
24923,"this course is very helpful to motivate oneself to create a website. but it looks like the authors themselves made the course in one weekend. the lectures are too short and not informative enough to complete the assignments. some videos don't show what the lecturer is talking about, maybe there is bug or something, but there is only some irrelevant picture. the due dates are inconsistent through different pages. finally, the next day after the course ends i am not able to view my assignments and the grade for the last assignment, even though the authors sent an email that it would be possible.",1

79729,"i base my ratings of courses on 3 things:1) is the material clear? 3/5yes, for the most part, though the lecturer sometimes gets mixed up and uses terms like ""class"" / ""object"" the wrong way.2) can i generalize from the material to other applications? 2/5this module spends a lot of time on c before you get to objective-c specific material, so you don't get much objective-c. there's a bit of a tour of xcode, but it's not particularly comprehensive. the apps you build are incredibly basic, and there's no real discussion of how to generalize from them.3) is the course presented in an engaging way? 1/5this course is super boring. if you already know c, a lot of the content is a waste of time, but i imagine that if you don't know c this is not a good way to pick it up.so overall 2/5one other thing - the assignments are graded in a pretty bizarre way. you have to take a screencap video of your code and your app in action, upload the video, and then wait for another person to enroll in the course and review your submission. in return, you have to review three other people's videos. sort of a rolling homework ponzi scheme. this strikes me as a system that could be greatly improved upon!",0

72245,very enthusiastic presentation and full of great information about the beatles. this course was truly a delight.,2
103821,the lectures are fairly light and there are no assignments throughout the course to reinforce the material. mostly they just introduce a few concepts then point you at the apple swift documentation. they really don't go into much detail.the final assignment is good for getting your feet wet but is poorly specified.,0
6577,too hard to follow,0
49824,"very helpful course in understanding basics of software engineering, but more so an insight into what programming is really like. i thought it would take long, but it didn't really. you get to the point where you want it to be good or you want it to be satisfactory - if you choose good then you'll be spending more time on it without realising. good course, friendly and honest reviewers. thanks everyone.",2
96323,"this class teaches you the essentials of bootstrap v3. it is by no means a complete course on bootstrap, but it will teach you how to use the main components effectively.",2
68584,"really just an overview of the topics to be explained in detail afterwards.big plus for the use of python + notebooks but otherwise, if one is interested just in the overview and not in all the specialization, maybe the andrew ng course is more detailed.",1
18490,the instructors overly explain simple concepts and talk about programming inbetween makes the course confusing then you get lost and quiz you on stuff that was not properly explaiuned,0
92583,"a bit light in terms of content, this probably could have been condensed down into 2 lessons.",0
106675,"way too slow and too long ; too many digressions, by-side remarks, lessons of life, etc ... go straight to the point.",0
43571,great insights into learn that should help anyone who wants to sharpen his skills,2
98920,if you spend some time through practicing basics later you can master much more complicated topics.blind and drunk kung fu master ... :),2
28711,"very good and useful course. and all the knowleges which i'd got from it i began to use now and will continue to use later in my usual life.p.s. sometimes there were too many names of researchers in the videos, but all of the findings were interesting by themselfes.and i want to give personal gratitude to prof. raj: thank you mr. raj for your positive, passion and help! i wish you a life of happiness and fulfillment!",2
2708,i like this programme its very helpful and encouraging for me to do programming,1
62998,the course stays a bit superficial,1
12260,"the teacher of this course talks toooo fast ! i`m for example a french educated student, so i prefer to take courses with a teacher who talks in a comprehensive way in which i can understand everything he says in order to proceed in my work and then to benefit everything in this course.concerning the quiz, in the all of the quiz there is questions not related to what already said from the teacher or in the articles required to read. i red the articles coupes of time but in a specific questions, the answers, it seems, that we should answer from our own memory because badly it`s not mentioned in any article or in the video of the teacher.thanks",1
39314,"i am a bit frustrated, as the course is built around this amazing tool: ibm bluemix, that gave us high hopes of extracting super useful information, but it is impossible to use. the instructions seem outdated and not relevant to the actual tool, there are lots of different sets that make it even more confusing and even after getting round a lot of the technical difficulties, the tool doesn't seem to be very useful... :( i feel like i wasted a lot of time trying to get this to work, with no results so far.",0
61570,the instructor is very bad. she made the lectures so boring with her lack of preparation that i switched to just reading the transcript. the assignments were lacking in case studies and were very textbooky. i could have skipped this course and simply read from the e-book. tried to get a refund but its too late so i will have to force through this one and the next. i hope it doesn't adversely affected my grades as i have scored above 96% in the previous 3 courses in this specialisation. very disappointed and frustrated. i came to coursera to avoid teachers and teaching styles like this. this really shakes my confidence in coursera for future courses. im definitely not going to pay for any courses in the future.,0
10088,"i would have liked to put 5 stars. this topic is so important and relevant to big data. after week 4 hands on part, it became obvious we will not see how to implement or interpret the more abstract graph concepts presented in week 3. that was very disappointing.moreover, the structure of the course is not as good as the other module. i don't understand the lack of balance between theory and hands on (not enough hands on to reflect the theory) part.on a constructive note, i would replace some of the theoretical concepts of week 3 with additional information on how to link a graph database to machine learning or i would add more hands on exercise to help using those more complex concepts and learn how to interpret them.",1
65790,nice course. very informative. it will built your skills strongly. thank you very much coursera & moscow institute of physics & technology.,2
99937,"it was interesting to learn on how to better manage my time, although was too theoretical.",1
11429,this course mainly focus on statistics and statistical parameters and almost nothing about about understanding clinical research - as title anotate,1
87238,"excellent, very interesting and well taught course. takes a complex subject and makes it understandable and fun to learn.",2
56548,"excellent project, thanks for share",2

62938,"actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading",0
101824,"a little bit old, and too many references to others courses",0
83224,thank you for providing an excellent introduction to managing people at work. i have found some really good ideas and resources from this course that i will be using in my current job.,2
85967,in my opinion a clear guideline is missing. the terms are not always the same and it's sometimes confusing.,1
25827,"great walkthroughs of features and concepts, fun to do.",2
42971,"thank you so much,",2
23449,good content but extremely basic,1

93881,"i was really hoping to complete the data science specialization, but i have found the first couple of courses to be not very cohesive. this course in particular was ok, but lectures and application (projects and assignments) had such a wide gap between them i found that i was mostly teaching myself...",0

85390,"awesome courses, help you get close to functional programming.",2
10937,"it absolutely amazing course , i personally benefit a lot. really it's not just the certificate .thank you coursera for this huge chance.",0
38688,"excellent course! learning java, android and also to think differently, will open your mind to think of different methods to implement and create applications.",2
69468,that was amazing!!!really helps,2
43378,"very very good course to understand working of human brain in general and its effect on new learning ,development of self and lots more by very easy method. both the tutors are very easy to understand. thanks a lot.",2
68832,very approachable method that gets more in depth at a good pace. the later courses in the specialization dive deeper and get into the more complicated math.,2
20209,funny presentation and helpful powerpoint,2

93869,"they don't give enough inputs and instructions to complete the assignments, unless they could offer addicional material.",0
533,"v difficult, but rewarding!i did not get the grade i thought i would in this class...but i learned a lot more than i thought i could! very in depth and thorough, i think i value the knowledge i received more than the sub-par grade i received. ;)",2

33325,well- organized. comprehensive. and much fun!,2
47952,"only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless. course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms. if you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.",1
17296,"i'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course. if you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course. the course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will not teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.i recommend the machine learning course (from bill's colleagues) at university of washington. that is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).",0
106805,"very helpful and informative, not mention motivating!",2

6604,"the positive.what a wealth of material! this is a very worthy attempt to integrate the history, philosophical underpinnings and modern transformations of tibetan buddhist meditation.clifford saron’s week 2 lectures on neuroscience and neuroplasticity were fascinating and intriguing introductions to the topic - very engaging.the negative.too academic for an introductory course. david germano’s lectures are full of information but he doesn’t help the learner to make sense of it. his ‘academic speak’ obfuscates meaning rather than making it accessible. more diagrammatic slides at the start would give learners a framework of the overarching concepts.because of the many perspectives presented each week, this course needs a lot of time. i personally would have leaned better if the course were broken into smaller weekly segments.",1
36570,a course that makes difficult terms of finance to sound natural of course because of professor robert shiller that has a deep knowledge in finance.,2
100059,honestly i really already knew most of the things in this course. it was nice though to receive it in a academic setting. was hoping to gain a little more skill from the course.,1
61627,"for multiple modules, the questions were out of order. some of the videos didn't seem polished to the point that it made me think it was not the final edits?also, from other coursera courses, i really valued interviews and summaries that highlighted the key points (vs a summary of the topics convered).finally, the module quizzes didn't seem to highlight the key points, but instead had questions specific to not-so-important details (e.g., which agency created the mb campaign).",0
7885,"there's a little bit too much in the way of ""buy organic!"" when there's no evidence to recommend that but other than that a very nice course. i would recommend that they retool it to be more accessible to people on the lower income brackets. i got news for you, ""almond flour"" is not something most people are going to spring for when it costs several times what wheat flour does.",2
37727,i learned so much. it also helped me structure my code better than what i have done before.,2
23702,"beautifully executed and fun to hear michael pollen speak, but sooooo easy. too easy, really.",1

48697,"most video's are spoken in a sort of 'franglais' that is barely understandable, very annoying.",0
31367,great course to anyone who wants to teach second languages.,2
101553,"the most challenging course of the specialisation, as the concepts are fairly technical and the quizzes demand a bit more ""thinking around the corner"". sean pinder's videos and slides are excellent. the quality of the exam materials was not quite up to par (several issues were reported by users and fixed later on).",2
79306,an effective way of delivering problem solving techniques & tools. liked the pace of the course which suited my schedule.,2
22738,"this is a good course to introduce the novice to financial terms used in common place.but in my opinion, the instructor could have a gone a bit further, explaining about markets, stocks, bonds etc.types of transactions involved.maybe its expecting too much, but still, just a suggestion",1
7789,it's good for people who are beginners in cooking.,1
19476,i simply love you guys! that explains everything,2
54796,"the best of this course (by far in my opinion) is how i learned how to accurately measure the performance of a learning algorithms, and how to know where i should spend my time trying to improve it.previously, i have spent some time trying to work on fitting data and i ended up frustrated. i ended up with the believe fitting data had too much guess-work and it was not possible to actually know what's going on and why my fitting algorithms didn't work as i expected.with this course, i regained my love for optimization algorithms, and i'm very motivated to apply those new performance measuring techniques that certainly are indispensable to build high quality machine learning programs.",2
43628,"this course has changed my life, not only in studying and learning, but setting goals. barbara and terrence are very helpful at helping us learn, and even use the methods they teach, to teach to us. i feel proud because this is the first formal qualification i have ever achieved, and i feel as if i can approach any study, academic or industry, and even informally. thank you to everyone involved.",2
17121,"i appreciate this course and the instructor's time, but so far i haven't really learned anything.the structure of every lesson is:""1. here are the 5 things we're going to cover. 2. name (not explain) those 5 things. 3. here are the 5 things we covered""i think there's a lot of potential for this course in the long run. i would advise having a professor from illinois who is not in the business school take this course and get their feedback. i believe the instructor is very smart and experienced in this area, so this is definitely a course that could grow into a coursera essential.",0
20056,it was very simple and easily understandable at all levels. this course has made me understand the concepts clearly. thank you.,2
17097,nothing practical,0
89389,"i love how clear the information is, and the instructor's enthusiasm keeps me interested.",2
40145,"the course is a good overall approach to human-computer interaction. it teaches how to do participan observation, interviewing, storyboarding and heuristic evaluation.however, i would say that some of the assignments were too simple in terms of complexity and there was few opportunities to apply the theory in the assignments.in general i found the course useful for people who want to learn more about how understand better customer necessities, for design in general.",1

55210,andrew is a great teacher. i loved how he broke down everything into simple easily consumable information. i came into this course with a relatively good understanding of linear algebra and statistics so it made things a lot more easier. highly recommend the course to anyone looking to get some hands on experience with machine learning.,2
90848,"i think this course does not a good job of explaining the mathematics very well. the supplementary material is very good in that regard, compared to the lectures. however, there are too few to make up for it. i would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercises.as a result, my learning success is not very satisfactory.",0

93704,bit tough and the professor's were rushing through the course in videos.,1
101540,this course was a good refresher of mathematical and statistical concepts. i found the mathematical and statistical concepts applied to modelling interesting. i never knew that what i learned in high school in the past can actually be used to come up with models to solve business problems. some videos were a bit long though.,1
87281,dr. chuck is awesome!,2
86095,really too basic for meaningful learning. the instructor was not very engaging and by the end of the course just seemed hungry and ready to be done.,0
17997,"really disappointing. the slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality (that's the reason i'm giving it 2 stars and not just 1)... but the course itself is bad: it covers many algorithms, but so superficially that you learn nothing; and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the concepts.i would love to see this be turned into a 5-course, 30-week specialization in itself (and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these 30 weeks)... but as a single course over 4 weeks, it's not good.",0

5018,"content was very good. i didn't liked the assignments, they were too short and the answering options were too narrow; sometimes they could be misinterpreted and led to a confusing missing point. i would recommend to add several more questions for each assignment, chosen random for each attempt, put a limit on total attempts and give feedback on answers. thanks for the course, i enjoyed it a lot; short but precise.",2

73729,"the lectures are well prepared, and the assignments are adapted to the learner, regardless of whether the learner had (or did not) any previous experience in programming. i personally used the forum only for the last assignment, and received the necessary help. i deem it safe to say that i enjoyed this course. thank you to the team and to coursera.",2
49342,it was great overall but my review reflects the sentiment that i felt like they could've added more topics.,1
34920,having to pay before you take the course is really disappointing. not many students to interact with because of this. course was very basic also. not worth the money. coursera offers many quality courses which are much better than this one.,0
90894,"good ,but many complaints regarding pid tuning from students need to be addressed in the upcoming sessions",1
33917,"not up to the standard of the previous two courses. the material was already covered in the first course - fundamentals of graphic design - and nothing new was brought to the table. even the assignments were a re-hash of the ones from the first course. i realize the point of the lack of specific guidance was intended to encourage us to explore the ""making"" of multiple iterations of the images. i just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy.",0
39294,i really did want to take this course in a specialization mode. however i sampled some of the course videos in the different courses making this specialization and decided against it.in the course videos we see no teacher or lecturer just pictures of people and power-point slides with a flat voice in the background reading the slides. in my opinion this does very little in making this topic interesting as it comes out flat and more work should have been put into making of this mooc considering one has to pay for the specialization. there were also no discussion forums of any kind available. more work should be put into the making of the lecture videos by the school to give it a realistic classroom experience.unfortunately i dropped out of the mooc because of the poor quality done by the school despite it being a topic of interest for me.,0
77976,the videos were very slow and many contained useless information.,1
92459,"i think someone who has never coded before can approach this course. however, further reading of the resources presented will augment what has been taught and to better handle the quizzes.",1
25103,this course doesn't teach much beyond how to use galaxy tools.,0
49503,good for electronics beginners,2
100396,i found this course very useful for my phd program,2
61545,"this type of course structure may work at an undergrad level, but for continuing education it is sub-par.the video lectures were the instructor reading the slides, reading from the course reading, or showing videos that were listed in the course reading. the course quizzes had too many questions that focused on memorizing details from the case studies or a statistic shown for a bit in the lectures rather than try to foster understanding of the material.there were some technical issues such as links from the course readings expiring and not being replaced, in-lecture questions dealing with a subject matter different from the topic of the lecture, etc.the one good thing from this course - it uses a great textbook (free), which provides lots and lots of useful data and insights into digital marketing - and this is the sole reason the course gets 2 stars instead of 1.",0
105758,"exceptional content. high level text, graphs and references. prof. sachs is a great lecturer! so much we can learn from him and be better human beings.",2
50184,extraordinary videos!! a big hand to professor craig wright,2
90768,"the video lectures provide an introduction to quadrotor flight dynamics and path planning. the lectures are ok.unfortunately:at least one of the coding assignments has a significant bug in the termination condition. the mentors will ignore any help requests that deal with the bug in their code.the assignments involve a lot of hand tuning of pd controllers. that's a reasonable task to perform once or twice, but it rapidly becomes extremely tedious and detracts from the other materials that are being taught.the final assignment doesn't do a particularly good job evaluating the required test condition.if you do take the course i'd want you to know:you should expect to modify the provided code to fix their bugs.there are no ""gotcha"" quiz questions. if you are confused by getting a question wrong you might want to re-try your answer. there seems to be a bug in the way at least one quiz question is set up.on the final assignment you can modify the simulation step where it makes things run in ""real time"". removing that step makes the simulation run much more quickly and allows for faster iteration.to conclude:this is a course with a lot of potential, but unless coursera makes an effort to improve the course i would not recommend it.",0
13190,very slow and boring. needs better and more relevant examples. instruction should be more fast paced.,0
58315,"great, although there are some trouble for completed assignments. eg. patch for octave.",2
72384,it seems like the course loses its focus about on-half of the way through. it stops being about music and suddenly becomes a discussion about liberal social issues. i completely lost interest in it at that point.,0
39856,"just a perfect improvisation course from gary's heart! thank you gary!! there's only one con, the assignments are peer reviewed only (not teacher feedback at all).",2
71905,"extremely useful course, the instructor is a very experienced and a very nice person too. highly recommended.",2
106932,the interviews and course discussion are invaluable in this course.,1
20709,poorly done,0
80766,"good context, however, long videos, didn’t catch my attention.",0
12819,i rate this course with 5 because is focused on teaching the secrity from a management perspective and teach the right way to get things done,2
104789,"not explained well, had to take another statistical inference course. not worth the money.",0
75789,thank for the general support from um.,2
24801,great learning !,2
88736,it was such an awesome specialization. it really opened my eyes to a lot of python :d,2
84330,i really like the course content and the instructor is nice,2
36721,fantastic from start to finish,2
3404,steps for exercises are not clear.,1
55561,"thank you for having this course. i enjoyed it thoroughly, the materials were well prepared and the programming exercises were excellent. i would be really happy to be a part of more of such courses from stanford. awesome work guys!",2
87435,great course. beyond basic knowledge of python.,2
100432,this course relies heavily on self-reading and theoretical knowledge. video interviews which are part of the curriculum are mostly not useful. overall the course did not provide me with the value i was looking for.,0
82461,"great course but the final assignment is really tough. hence, it would be great if more examples were given and the inclusion of an additional assignment at wk 2 would help too.",1
106125,"very useful, very valuable.i had learn so many skills from this course.thank you for this course, and coursera.",2
57921,"best mooc class i've taken. andrew ng explains the concepts behind ml very well without delving too much into the math or programming concepts. very thorough and well presented, perfect for a first exposure to machine learning.",2
87817,i really enjoyed this course and dr. chuck. can't wait for the next one.,2
13548,pros:effort has been taken in putting up the assignments.cons:quality of teaching is very poor and too fast to follow through . instructors have rushed to present course material . i would not recommend this course . princeton and stanford offer much higher quality and presentation on the same topics.,0
58999,a basic and systematical,2
79402,"this course is an excellent introduction to personal branding. in taking this course i have gained a better understanding of the basics of social media use, and professional focus.",2
29491,"lots of readings! would have loved a more engaging format. also found the content slightly ambiguous, you might have to do some trial and error and might be surprised at the answers in the quiz.",0
103984,"teachers poorly prepared, explanations ambiguous, it seems that they didn't pay attention to examples and sound of the course.i love jack wu written tutorials... way better than videos.",0
89330,"2 weeks were balanced and thought-provoking and one was silly, but entertaining... therefore three starts with 2 stars taken out for ending a good course with a week of silliness.",1
60981,great!,2
24429,examples have to be more clear. i cant seem to get anything correct because of computers,0
99616,the course does not make you learn spreadsheets in detail.,1
94463,"with all respect, professor, if you are reading all our comments, i think you are a really smart person and you should take all the negative feedback from your students here, positively and constructively. as having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students. personally, i feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your students/audience. use more simple examples, draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about, what are we going to achieve, in each of the topics, what are we going to look at and what methods available.for foundation class like this, i think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us. the objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge, get us interested in this subject, and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge. as when we are interested, for sure we will go and do more research, and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levels.the key point here is ""speak to the level of your audience"". even if you are able to talk everything above the sky and up to the moon. if no one able to understand you, it is useless.",0
41279,thanks,2
84336,"great teacher,the class is funny,the process is clear",2
66736,"i was enrolled in the full specialisation and things went great for the 2 first courses i did, which were mostly peer-review-based (logistics & sourcing).with this one i gave up feeling really unassisted and unable to get answers to my feedback requests. no feedback is provided when you ask something in the forums, ever.when you flag a milestone because of technical issues you won't be ever answered (even when you upload screenshots as proof).the practical exercises with spreadsheets are poorly explained and even contradicted, especially as far as cutting and/or rounding integers are concerned. this is something that can prove 'costly' when doing the quizzes i failed all the questions of all the quizzes for all the attempts i tried. i'm not sure if this is coursera's fault or rutgers' but i don't think i will take ever another course (paying) here in coursera with these kind of calculation quizzes, it's a waste of time.i can't imagine how a mathematical or programming course must be with this poor approach of assessing the results. i suppose i will be censored if i explicitly mention similar sites to coursera but these kind of tests and quizzes are much more better addressed.in a nutshell, i subscribed to the full specialisation paying 45 eur per month, the first month i was able to certificate myself with the 2 first i did ( logistics & sourcing), this second month (planning & operations) that has just started i gave up, so my final outcome is 2 certificates for 45 eur each one.tolerable but you'll never get me here again.",0
6078,"why is this course dangerous?i took this course because first i liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe. maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics. but as it turned out they don't have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means. they always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system. i think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isn't a closed system.in the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught. but if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you. one glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months. they are cherry picking. they just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma. in this respect they are so dangerous. that is the same principle how cults work.maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one. but also here you have to be careful. when they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50! in my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way. for sure it is not helpful! but again, the truth doesn't fit in their world view.furthermore they ""teach"" that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the ""universe balancing entropy"". this isn't just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.in summary: this is not a history course, but the ""teachings"" of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.so please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.",0
68981,"even though the course discusses relevant topics, the level is extremely low: the lab sessions were easily solved applying copy-paste code from the provided notebooks, with minor adaptions. moreover, 8/10 questions in the lab sessions were not related to machine learning at all, but simply looping over data and counting or similar. the intro video and course introduction strongly suggested using deep learning in the course: did not happen. we trained k-means on pre-computed features which happened to come from from a deep learning network (not sure which one, inception? i didn't even watch the lectures here from disappointment). that is not deep learning, it just shows you how well deep learning can work.graphlab is a mature framework, i guess, but it's commercial and scikit-learn is better imho (and free!).if you wish to learn machine learning, take the stanford course on machine learning for andrew ng. this course is in matlab, not ideal for machine learning, but adequate for a better understanding of intelligent system implementations.maybe the course is ok if you're a beginner in machine learning, but not good.",0
39926,"while the content is very helpful and gary does his best to make people confident to improvise in jazz music, this course has imho two major flaws:the biggest one: assignments given and results accepted do not fit together. e.g. in week 1 learners are supposed to describe in their own words how a piece of music does sound like. but the accepted answers are totally different from such a description. instead only a very detailed and specialized answer is accepted. this leads to studends copying these answers into their assignments without them learning anything.the other flaw is that gary is very brief in his explanations. even intermediate musicians seem to struggle with content just because some explanations are not exact or vague.",0
18480,"really poor course. rather than starting from the basics, this course picks random information to work with. week 1 was information anybody with a computer knows. week 2 was really good. week 3 and 4 were completely useless. rather than starting from the basics they jump into picture manipulation and encoding. don't take this class if you want to learn about coding.",0
3033,"decent course overall, but problem solutions are much missed. even after completing the course perfectly i'm still not sure how i got some answers.for example: ""approximate f^(72)(0) of cos(x^3). i figured the way to solve it, but i hove no idea why it is solved that way.",1
71615,great!,2
7,"i was disappointed because the name is misleading. the course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the cto, but has very little specifically digital content. it deals with two-speed it in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. it is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the mckinsey website for example.",1
103995,the lectures for this course seem unorganized and often had poor audio. the content covered in many lectures seemed off topic. quiz questions would then focus on the off topic information making it confusing with regard to what material to focus on during a lecture. do i focus on the proposed subject of the video or the many tangents about other topics. this combined with the unorganized nature of videos(just winging it) made the lectures distracting. the lecture videos are full of code that simply does not work in the real world and help from staff takes literally days to get(and not just over the weekend).,0
96499,it nice to be building on one examples and see different ways to do it.,2
64132,"i had an enjoyable morning to learn the modern politics of the middle east, thank you for giving me a chance learn by the course coordinators, lectureres and big thanks to coursera!",2
5442,"overall this course has some valuable information. although, i found the pace was a bit fast, only covered enough to get by, not gradually building up to a point. each assignment or lab you first have to struggle figuring out the skeleton code where they could have provided a bit more comments, tips and guidance. i would recommend this course for someone that at least have a basic java or programming background. not for complete new developers.",1
245,i love professor brian j bushee!!,2
78401,"it is great learning experience. this is my first online course, but it is very interactive. this can be understood by all beginers with ease by the well quoted examples on how to approach for programming.",2
92276,i do not find this course is useful to learn seems it only gives a guideline to the python database.,1

10878,very informative. i like the additional resources offered for further learning.,2
18636,"html and css were great. javascript was very confusing as it did not teach me what each part of the code meant, including the syntax --- and hence i was unable to understand anything by week 4, despite having listened to all the lectures and participated in the all the activities. i wish javascript's structure was more consistent with that of html and css.",0
