11681,"i've already written a review for part 1 and i have the same opinion about this one. the course is rather poor and not challenging. only general information about relevant topics that as well read on wikipedia. no exercises, no code assignments. a lot of this content was repeated from first two parts of this specialization.",0
104278,"i was unable to complete this course, because the course required at least two years of programming knowledge prior to enrolling. i was confident that i could learn while taking the course, but i continually failed to pass the quizzes in the second of five courses. it was very confusing and the questions were cryptic",0
71811,"unfortunately i think the level for this course is very low and not worth paying for, it has a very local perspective of logistics (not involving international logistics but only us operations), there's no communication with the professor or assistants, so it's basically watching a few very short videos explaining general concepts that apply only to certain types of operations.the assignments are very vague, with no requirements or restrictions provided, basically anyone can write anything and as long as you follow the requested format it will be graded ok; grading is not based content and therefore there's no way to know whether you're learning and applying the concepts properly or not.wouldn't recommend paying for it.",0
29800,"its ok, i didn't learn a little and i didn't learn a lot.",1
32494,thank you to all the members of course on this great effort has been spectacular and of course benefited him a lot and was very entertaining explanation you are great,2

32380,best course in the specialization so far!,2
29383,"a waste of money. only $50, but it was so terrible i did not even want to finish it. and apparently i waited too long to get a refund as well. never again.",0
86369,the way dr. chuck teaches and shares his knowledge is way too much fun and easy to understand. made me to think that python is easy to work and more enjoyable. thanks to dr. chuck and coursera.please carry on with your great service to the online community!!,2
38653,i should say that this course is the best for beginner learner requirement,2
5039,"i had a really great time with this course. a lot of work went into it, from the presentation to the content. really well done. it was quite challenging. i felt that the last module (7) introduced some very difficult concepts which, even after checking other sources, i couldn't understand fully. some questions from the exam in that module were substantially different from the ones in the lectures. i would give 4.5 stars if i could.",2
85516,i love how this instructor runs the corse.,2
65177,good course.,1
14307,"not really specific, just a broad indtroduction to data analysis.",1
104767,"this course seems weirdly balanced between assuming one knows very little about statistics while also assuming one is intimately familiar with statistics notation and terminology. it would probably be better if the data science track had an optional ""intro to statistics"" class that can take more time to let students familiarize themselves with the terminology, and then a separate ""ins and outs of probability testing in r"" for those already familiar. this course seems to try and bite off more than it can chew by attempting to be both at the same time.still, the lectures are interesting and the material is important to learn / cover.",0
33700,it was very useful!thank you!,2
95509,the course is very interesting. the jupiter notebook is very useful.i don't like that many examples are very us-specific. some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside usa.update: i'm lowering my grade from 4 stars to 3 stars because of very confusing assignments. often it's not clear the requirement of the task. it takes very long to understand. also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures.,1
95173,"the course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. however, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. the problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another (same purpose) or you spend our to manipulate a pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement (for instance). so, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. positive point: excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone.",1
49828,what a wonderful course!!!,2
88206,the teacher can explain more and not just read through the slides.,0
96828,"that was quite a fascinating course, at least for someone who does not know anything about anthropology. the tutor did an outstanding job and also provided good readings. highly recommended.",2
99683,"this course needs tremendous improvement. in contrast to previous fundamentals of quantitative modelling module, this lags in lot of areas. no clear explanations and the quizzes are worded super vague and filled with with bugs. i expected a lot under monte carlo simulation. however, too simplistic example and explanation was presented. the topics were not introduced clearly.",1
23319,very inspirational and easy to follow.,2
72074,i have reached my professional goals thanks to the courses i have taken on coursera.,2
42325,i just started the course and i'm going to stop this course right away. in my opinion showing hitler as an appropriate leader is not the course i want to visit! i do not upport any racist mindset.,0
39505,introduction is fine. but was less interactive. found instructor reading slides only throughout the lecture which was boring and less interesting. like other coursera course i found it boring whatever text on slide i learnt but nothing interactive and practical. just a slide reading. very much theoretical. disappointed,0
106216,this was the worst course i have taken with asu on coursera. feedback was minimal and the system had many technical issues. videos didn't start properly and there was no help or feedback from the instructors or the peers. i have wasted a lot of time resubmitting my assignments due to technical issues. waste of my time.,0

81252,i have learned a lot about seo from this course. 100% excellent course.,2
72317,"great assignments! very practical oriented course. after finishing, i really feel that i learned something and improved my skills.",2
78935,"this course will teach you a little bit of statistics and leave you confused with r. the first four weeks are very straightforward. they give r code for everything. however, this is not good because it does not prepare you well for the last project in which you have to do the whole project using r. this is almost like learning how to cook without knowing how to use a knife.",0
95986,"i felt the course was ok, but wanted more. it seemed very general, even with the focus in the end on e-types.",1
37894,great course. fast paced for the absolute beginner,2
106729,its a great course that gives a lot of good and solid and useful information about the issues at work.,2
4571,"so many equations presented without explaining why these things work or how they are derived. i'm having a hard time seeing the relevance. also, i learned a lot of these statistics in college and the explanations provided in these lessons actually confused me about things i already know. very disappointed in this course. especially since part 1 of the specialization was so good.",0
13903,"very, very, very basic intro. the entire 4 weeks could have (and should have) been condensed into 1 week.",0
50968,"difference between a software project and a software product - of course it is defined by convention, but it is there and is pretty generally understood. typical software projects are bespoke applications developed for the use of one organization and typically automates a business process. a s/w product, on the other hand, is built and sold to a range of users in the target group, who can be individuals to large organizations. this course does not seem to address any of the issues faced by a s/w product manager. i think this course completely misses the point.",0
104880,very difficult to understand and follow,0
10634,"this seemed more appropriate for a startup, and most of the content was rudimentary",0
100461,really didn't like the course.,0
104156,there is no any discusson forums in there. it's so disappointing. i've paid for course and unable to ask questions.,0
6543,the course appears unfinished and very disorganized. the lectures are monotonous and boring.,0
98094,"my congratulations for this course. was a great experience to learn about this topic and the important for our future.additionally, i would like to make some suggestions especially related with approach on developed countries, developing countries and the data stat.inside these aspects should be included examples related with latin america, asia and another regions that not been included between the classics examples of developed countries.thanks for this course.",2
100403,"this course is a good first step towards research in any field. research is something important and delicate and this is a great way to start understanding its purpose, tools and activities.",2
57795,a very good course,2
2396,very good trip !,2
49485,"the professor lecturers were great! i enjoyed watching the his videos. however, theres's still room for some improvement. for example, i would add /more/ technical info at the video slides and also a /lot/ of literature related to iot and embedded systems.",1
12443,good experience of using the big data tools but a total lack of engagement in the forums by the instructors and community mentors make it hard going if anything goes wrong. the final quiz took me over 8 hours mostly because there was no one to ask for hints when i was totally stuck and confused!,1
79643,"very interesting, high scientific content, topics are progressives and lead to a good comprehension of the physical phenomenon on going.exercices are a good complement to the main lecture.experiment captured in video were a very good surprise.",2
89983,it could be a bit more challenging than just running scripts.,0
12753,thank you for this course. it was very interesting,2
61642,"un-organized, scattered non professional course. all the materials keep changing during the course. materials in each module includes readings and exams were not related. though, i enjoyed the other courses in this series and think they were great, but i am afraid this one was a real disappointment.",0
95313,"content is actually very good, i can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems. projects and assignments are quite useful, and i can expect to use skills i acquired in my day to day work. however, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study. i spend tons of time on google search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forums in order to find the right way(sometimes optimal way) to finish the assignments. i understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but i really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me.i'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts. i won't deny i learned a lot through this course, but i believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available. if the majority of course is spent on googling, what's the point to take it?",0
67077,"great content. teaching style could be improved for the medium. a couple of errors that should be rectified. the course seems poorly maintained. it is pity because it is content really valuable and ""hot"".",2
76537,"i didn't like how there was no interaction with the other classmates or there was no easy way to comment, but i loved the way it was so interactive",1
65186,this course and its related courses are rough around the edges. things are not always intuitive.,0
5675,"the entirety of this course is ""watch and listen"". there are no hands-on activities/assignments that get you implementing what you are (supposedly) learning. the assignments that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picture.for example - they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky, but they don't actually give you a required assignment. it's optional. then the actual assignment is ""do this here, and this here, and then this here"" and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code. but this doesn't actually show you how to build the intent. all you did was write down what they told you to and where. you never actually build anything yourself. you don't actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratch.the quizzes are also pointless. every quiz is multiple choice, select all that apply. there's no thought required, just regurgitation of info from the lectures.also, the entire week 1 lectures are horrible. the lectures on git are sssoooo dull that i could not stay awake no matter how much i wanted to. they are given in a monotone, bored tone that will drive you insane.overall, this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together, without much thought, and then never looked at again. i would not recommend anyone take this course, let alone pay for it.",0
61603,"the lessons on presentation skills and traditional media should have taken just one one or two minutes, and one or two slides, at most. the details and time invested really had little to do with digital marketing or the digital landscape. the use of the hand-written pros and cons was an unnecessary novelty. regular bullet text are more readable and technically more reliable. most of all, the presenter's style was distracting. it seemed that she was unsure of her subject matter and script. i recommend re-scripting and rehearsing the presentation -- before re-shooting it. finally, with the rapid pace of change in digital, we should not be using reading material more than two or three years old. five years is tantamount to a generation in the digital world.",0
4318,"pros:- classification lecture is good;-weekly assignments are challenging enoughcons- no slides provided. professor draws on an eletronic chalkboard (with a very bad handwriting) and you need to keep going back to videos when you are doing the homework. for me, this shows lack of professionalism and laziness- some excel sheets are provided. but they are very messy and badly formatted, matching the messy handwriting in the videos. and, the instructions are for mac! no instructions for pc are provided whatsoever. i never used mac, so i had a very hard time!- very few examples real examples are provided;- you learn math concepts, not excel skills! except for the linest function, which is very handy, but it's not taught in the videos. i had to google the function to learn it.- they say to complete each piece of the final assingment after you finish the respective week related to that piece. but they only say that as you start week 6!- the course doesn't provide sufficient material for the final assignment. you get stuck without knowing how to get to answers;- some answers to the final assignment are not correct, you check the answer sheet, and the results aren't present in the test!overall:i'd never recommend this course to anyone. i only took it because i'm plannening to finish the specialization.i've taken several online courses (5+ on excel), and this is the worst and most frustating one by far!",0
2758,yet another good course that is ruined by a peer review requirement. dr. singer is a fascinating person to learn from and i am glad i took the time to pursue the course.,0
4321,quiz does not require hands-on experience of creating templates but rather simply plugging in numbers. students may forget most of the content after finishing the quiz.,1
65400,explanations of concepts are too complex for non-biologist who want to approach the genomic field,0
94621,great lectures and really helpful simulations. very engaging and interesting. full of useful resources.,2
72634,"i've spent a bit of time going through the specialisation (paid for one course here) and other courses online that offer machine learning with python. i looked at books too. i've come to the conclusion that it's unforgivable to teach it using graphlab (that you have to pay for after free licence expiry) when everyone else teaches scikit learn (sklearn) for good reason.the tools used on this course are also not very good.everyone else teaches using text editors - for a good reason, you learn how to code properly.the lessons are also dry and there are far too many of them.",0
93436,"i'm giving this course one star because zero stars is not an option.i wish i had read course reviews prior to beginning. first assignment was tough... but do-able. second assignment seems straight forward, but the template they ask that you follow contains small tricks which appear to be far beyond anything touched on in lectures.i'm actually going to fight for my money back, what a scam.",0
84755,good introduction to the material.,2
19969,important course for anyone...essential for energy professionals.,2
30038,"the course information is very interesting but covers the material too briefly. the topics were covered very quickly and not in very much depth. quizzes often asked questions in a way that was not covered in the course material and were therefore quite difficult to figure out at times. i'm taking this course series to learn the material, not to be tricked of failed on a quiz. also as this is a rather math-intensive subject, a more comprehensive review of the algebraic tools and skills required would be helpful. lastly, there were many mistakes with grammar and spelling in the written portions. i know english isn't everyone's first language, but if we are paying for these educational materials then it doesn't look very professional for there to be glaring errors repeatedly throughout the material. it's not that difficult to have a native speaker proof-read before publishing (i would be happy to do this for you, any job openings?). just some thoughts.",0
76120,awesome course. nice materials provided to learn for beginners.,2
88245,very nice theory and very useful practical case with all advises that help to get the best results! appreciate everyone from uci and margaret for this chance to master project management!,2
57603,"it was really an excellent course. it was challenging but feasable with a huge quantity & quality of knowledges. i have learned a lot of things about machine learning. thanks a lot, mr andrew ng",2
76115,fun but easy,2
25348,really great and interesting course!professor is a great speaker too!,2
64489,this course is awesome. it teaches from the ground and easy to understand all the contents.it helps to build up concept and is very helpful for further detail study in the same topic .,2
8521,great course with great instructors,2
3566,so so.not good to learn an algorithm,1
42434,"good, informative and precise. thank you prof. doug thomas.",2
2666,thank you,2
38673,"the course doesn't allow access to the quizzes unless you pay for it. i consider this to be contradictory with the statement that the free version of the course gives you access to all the material. also, not being able to take the quizzes makes the course meaningless.",0
93723,great course for a shallow introduction to r programming.,2
39220,i feel like 8 weeks was too short and the project was too rushed. but overall of good value.,2
12146,"given the nature of law courses (a lot of reading), there needs to be a great deal more written information on the lecture slides. quotes from pieces of legislation, judgements from various courts, quotes from politicians etc. need to be provided on the slides, otherwise students are either left to search through the transcript, which contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, or write what prof. gearey is saying which means continuously stopping and starting the lectures to get it all down. in short: better lecture slides with more information on.",1
15311,"a decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. however, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of sas or python. the course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool.",1
6278,"excellent course, with a great variety of topics regarding animal welfare.",2
10657,"needed more depth, which still could have been achieved in a 1-week format",1
16569,cyber security is miniscule in the topic. mobility poses severe cyber security threat and syllabus is talking about mdm which is for compliance and cyber security.,0
39911,great lessons i would hope it would be more extensive in terms of lessons. i hoped for more detailed technical music theory.,2
23049,"i actually enjoyed this class very much, but it doesn't go very deep in the topic. the questions to the quiz are very easy to answer to. in my opinion, this class is great for a general public, but it is not an university level course.",1
93793,"it is fantastic! thank you roger, brian and jeff!",2
94464,"given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as glm or model selection techniques.",1
2209,it's a good class and i learned a lot. the learning curve shoots up exponentially around the fourth week. i could see this course being perfect if broken down into two classes.,1
94996,"the course doesn't feel complete, the information and techniques used for assignments can be found completely online through documentation and instead this is merely an exercise for doing basic analysis through documentation rather than an explanation of python through data science (which is what i anticipated)",1
80967,wow! i really learned a lot in this course! i will certainly be recommending this,2
102275,course academy and historic,0
97400,not so practical,1
63015,it's a grate course with an important topic for all hobby conductors. i'd learn a lot of practicable things to conduct and rehearse an orchestra of hobby musicians.,2
48399,"i can access to some contents: videos and lectures, but i can not send quizzes or assignments and to get feedback without paying a fee for this course, very limited! :(",0
9799,it's better to watch the youtube videos to understand the concepts.,0
101405,"i believe this was a very good course for beginners. however, from wharton, i would have expected more realistic examples. i would have also liked some hands-on assignments. but, otherwise.. great, great course from a beginners point-of-view! thank you so much!",1
104677,"i thought the videos and interviews were great but i would prefer these separated from the lectures on tangible material. i kind of feel like the course was rudderless and just gave some headlines and then said to go figure it out on your own, but be inspired by all of these extremely successful people. i would like to see the course get into more depth, for example where to start on market research. where to start on budgeting, and how to go about developing some of these specific business aspects. i enjoy shlmo's lectures but just wish some of this course ""zoomed in"" to me and seemed too ""zoomed out""",1
17966,"none of the previous classes will prepare you for this one. this is not really a class, but rather a project on a topic never covered in any of the previous classes in this specialization.",0
66704,"it was a very interesting course, however it was biased toward spanish history with the inclusions. i was really more interested in what i thought the course was supposed to be about anyway, medieval manuscripts. i had a terrible time deciphering the lecturer's english and, because i'm not interested in a course certificate, the course projects were a waste of my time, though i can see that they could be fun and add to the enjoyment of the course.",0

36505,this is exceptional and very helpful. this is really helping me out to understand what actual risk is and related matters to it.,2
48703,"i think it is a decent course to understand how the peer review process work. however, it does not really help to write a paper. i think some ideas are not applied to every field. in particular, telling students to look for the board of editors in a journal and adapt your results and how you express things accordingly, it is in my opinion a bit unethical. moreover, i was expecting that the course will be taught by a professor, but instead, it is done by a group of phds, some of them in their first year of research. if they intend to target a phd audience, this is clearly a drawback as some of them might know the same as you do. finally, as some people already pointed out, the quality of the english of some of the instructor is not good. in particular, there are a couple of them that you can't barely understand. it would have been more useful if the full course is taught by the 2 of them that can actually speak good.",0

61683,"only average. much is said, little information delivered.",1
90297,"the videos should be completely reconsidered. instructors pointing at virtual points on screen does not help at all. the course creators tried to squeeze in many concepts in 4 weeks. more examples should be provided in lectures, not just abstract math (e.g. lectures on projective transformation).",0

17770,"good, simple, straightforward, and applied. it starts to introduce you to the language and platforms of data science, but it is most definitely not a standalone course if you want to be conversant in the field. really just a ""taster"" to get you into the specialization.",1

30850,a good clear examination of basic punctuation and grammar. the lectures are well presented and the exercises useful. the element which really doesn't work is the peer assessment or review. this seems intended to replace forum discussions but it is not a good substitute (and there are no forums).,1

105689,this is one of the best courses that i've ever seen! and this is so crucial for us to understand everything claimed here and make our world sustainable. thank you for the course!,2
43067,this course was very helpful. could not be more grateful for the information.,2
20582,my name is jose antonio from brazil. i am looking for a new data scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)i did this course to complete my cv in english to the area of data science.the course was excellent and the classes well taught by teacher karen peterson.congratulations to coursera team.,2
102330,really good for this modern era.,2
72591,"an in-depth overview of the regression techniques and models. i think it went as deep into the concepts as i wanted it to go. being a developer i found it quite understandable, and useful.keep it up!",2
42939,the course was fun and engaging. also i really like the follow up emails with random bits of advice on how to learn and interesting recommendations for further reading material and exploration.,2
27725,"great course. i have a bs in physics from colorado school of mines, which is a tough school, and they didn't explain it as well",2
88727,"i really didn't learn much. too much code, too complex, too fast.",1
30112,"this course was wonderful. i learned new things about grammar and punctuation i don't recall learning in grade school while blending and improving my known knowledge. a tip for those thinking of just enrolling in one or two random courses of the five specialized courses, enroll in all. it is worth it even if you think you know. for instance, some of the papers in advance writing expect you to know some of the previous courses info and that could lead to some misunderstandings or struggles on quiz/peer reviews.",2
10624,"it was a bit.... general. that could be a bias of mine, as i have done quite a bit of management-type work, so maybe it didn't feel that new or informative.",1
90166,great course but programming assignments in matlab had too many issues.,1
25119,"this course did not make any effort until i had to dig deep into biology by myself. the course content is insufficient. i think if a sample input was used and every field of the input were explained and also the outputs were explained then it would make much more sense. poorly designed and demonstrated. thankfully i started the last assignment very quickly, it took me 10 days to understand how to proceed with the assignment. the ta is excellent, without his help i wouldn't pass this course.",0

18835,good hands on intro,2

25364,just read the ppt,0
15038,it's way to easy to be a separate course. it should be part of r programming.,1
12849,"the only reason to take this course is because the certification will look good on your resume. don't expect to learn anything new if you are already in it or related field. i passed the tests without going over the material. there is a shortage of original content, although their graphics and effects department did a good job, and mostly they expect you to read outside resources.audit the course for free to get familiar with the content but only pay if you need the certification for professional reasons.",0
77242,it's a great intro course to pythonprofessor severance is really great and brings it down to the lowest level one can understand.the assignment tool is pretty great as well. gives you the errors you need to work on.,2
72190,great insight. helps in understanding the significance of their contribution to rock and how they progressed as musicians and songwriters.,2
27235,very interesting course if you want to have an overview of how climate works. you will understand what we know but most importantly what we do not know on the subject. sadly there was no feedback at all from teachers...,1

38496,good cource. however more details should have been better,1
106225,i was expecting the capstone to be different than what it ended being. i didn't find it as practical and beneficial as the other courses.,0
39524,"interesting information, but the presentation of it is poor. the speaker is almost entirely reading from the powerpoint presentation you're being shown - they could have let you download that and you wouldn't have missed out on anything, really. disappointing.",0
66723,really well-explained introductory course for negotiations.i would have liked to see more reading materials and real cases explanaied apart to apply the concepts,2
7601,i think it pretty good for me to learn health!,2
90167,"this was an interesting course, however there were bugs and errors in most of the assignment materials, which really impaired the learning experience since much of it was reduced to debugging the course organiser's code... also the 3rd and fourth sections, including assignments, seemed to be rather small and to cover very little material, with little or no supporting material. moreover, course staff were conspicuous by their absence on the course forums. a stark contrast to the abundance of support provided and material covered in aerial robotics.",0
86310,"excellent course, very practical and based on a good theoritical foundation.",2

103429,"i do not want to rate this course at this stage but i would like to make the following comment in relation to the course resources and in particular the answers to the exercises in the optional text book.for students who do not have a copy of the text book, providing answers to questions from the text book without showing the actual questions is not very useful and to be quite frank, ridiculous. i would like to think that the course designers would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy this.how exactly this would be done is up to the course designers but i would suggest that another downloadable pdf document showing all the questions would be extremely useful and necessary.i look forward to a response.regards, trevor farley",0

40878,"compared to other courses in the specification, this course content is too shallow and brief.",1
63375,was not as good as previous courses in this specialisation,0
43554,"i wish i had taken this course 25 years ago. that said, this comes at a good time -- i'm pivoting my career. it really feels like applying these lessons could get me from an okay trajectory onto a great trajectory. this is the missing piece!",2
47816,i learnt many useful trick with this course. i recommend it.,2
36115,excellent course! however tough to manage all the technical terms if you're a newbie ;),2
63652,very well explained.tried to cover basic in very systematic way.,1
35201,great course!!,2
84217,highly effective course for me and my data science skills,2
79606,i loved this course and think everyone making music should take it!,2
37520,did not email when graded and had to email for everything to be fixed. example projects were not similar at all to actual projects and relied heavily on search engines to figure out what was asked of me,0
77085,this course really helped me get into the programing world.,2
8260,"the course content is okay and covers the basics well enough. however, the assignments are structured for memorization not learning and contribute little to the experience. i decided to cancel my subscription as there are better options on edx and other coursera courses.",0
99429,"awesome course! really helped me understand the angularjs framework and single page web application, in general.",2
57990,this is a great course which helps me understand the fundamentals of machine learning!,2
71643,"greed rules.... previously the course was free including the quizzes to check whether one learned something or not; now you have to pay 60$ just to check your learning progress (i do not need a certificate, just learning for myself)",0
74271,"very good ,easy to understand",2
27950,a very good way to know the basics of graphic design,2
66823,the course depended in big proportion of the material of rob stokes. it's ok to make the process as stokes suggest but i think you can put more of yourself.,1
95879,"i only did week one of the course and quit for the following reasons:presentation of the content is too fast and provides little information among lots of noise. most of what's said is generic keywords assembled in sentences that don't make much sense, or implies ""common sense"" evidences barely illustrated with vague figures and no sources to support them. it makes everything hard to follow for beginners and unconvincing for more advanced students.on top of that, i feel offended by the mysogynist examples and the underlying contradictory assumptions that designers outside of agile are basically incompetent while saying at the same time that they will just use methods they already know anyway.",0
93288,"the course is properly designed for people new to r programming, assignments are bit time consuming.overall i am happy with what i have learnt.",2
83222,"the course was fine. i would have rated it better if there were more practical examples, advice and real-life situations rather than so much theory.",1
104908,"the topics from this course are very important and might be considered convoluted at times, so it is nice to see that brian makes them actually easy to understand. very comprehensive and has nice examples.",2
76979,poor feedback and advice with those who really do not know of programming. to shame!,0
102937,"a bit too much javascript, but even that part was well done! i hope there will be another course with server-side scripting as well, at least for beginners :-)",2
93284,"this course is not set up right, the assignments ask you to do things that aren't explained until the next weeks content, its kind of discouraging. in the end, it does teach you the basics of r, its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravating.the reason i still only give it 2 stars is because of the quality of the courses itself. there are many, many 1 and 2 minute videos, these could've easily been combined. the teacher seems unprepared in his lectures, he stutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between slides. this shouldn't be necessary with pre-recorded lectures. the assignments and quizzes are also poorly written and contain spelling and sloppy mistakes, which doesn't make sense because the material isn't new. it all just makes it seem like the teacher doesn't really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effort.if you are not following the specialization i would not advise this course for beginners. i'm quite surprised to see the course get such high ratings.",0
42172,"i think participation in the forum discussion in this course seems not so active and less of interaction among students. if there are some incentives or some grading can be applied to push people to talk more, it will be a very good learning experience to all.",1
6605,"the course integrates information on practical benefits of meditation, results from scientific studies of neural responses, and historical and philosophical perspectives. also, i found the guided meditations very helpful and interviews quite interesting.",2
9109,"it is impossible to input solutions to quizzes/exams - even when they are correct, they are graded as wrong - a massive waste of time",0
39969,the gobbledygook mooc. worst bunch of talking a lot and saying nothing i ever encountered.,0
19024,"you can find your object in this course, but this course is too platitude to make me feel boring...",2
49516,"i felt it was too basic. it took me about a week, but if i'd had the time i could have done it all in a day. hope the rest of the specialization is more in-depth.. also there are no forums.. makes it impossible to interact when you have questions.",1
29463,"great course, great topics, well covered!",2
92775,"best in all opinion to learn r in such a planned order ...thank you coursera and john hopkins and definitely a big thanks to prof. roger d peng, jeff leek and brain caffo",2
89453,"an excellent course that really does provide you a challenge. some of the courses i have done on different moocs were rather too easy, but this one did push me a lot. it informs you in a clear, but detailed manner. it is necessary to do extra reading and to review videos and notes in order to complete assignments. best course yet",2
83167,great course. i learned things that i didn't think were possible.,2
12272,"a nice ""entry level"" course lacking a forum discussion... was not even able to report some issue with videos and no explanation provided with quizzes results :/",0

9843,"there are serious issues in the it infrastructure for this online course. coursera needs to upgrade their it infrastructure for it to be real time. you may go through the threads in help for more information and issues posted by other users.apart from this, it is extremely difficult to communicate with someone in coursera regarding anything and in any form, i.e email, live chat, etc.",0

87990,"this class' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course. the teachers, while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields, fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon. i'm not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren't used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them. as someone who was taking this class without that advantage, i was quickly lost among all the jargon, to the point where i just had to stop. i'm hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background.",0

18001,"a list of research papers to read further that's it. the course is too short to cover the subject so it covers nothing in the end.the programming assignment have no help, whatsoever it's ""do it"" any language. the 2 programming assignment doesn't have much to do with the course. we don't even talk about the algo to use to do it. it looks like coursera has asked the professor to add a programming assignment to the course and he had 3 minutes to choose what it could be.it shouldn't be advertised in coursera as it is.ah, forgot to mention that no one replies to the forums,actually no one uses them.i think the subject is very interesting but this course gives a really bad advertising to coursera, the university and the professor.it needs more work before it's deployed on the platform.i am going to try another coursera course in the same kind of subject i hope it won't be the same.",0

40512,"i worked really hard on this course, but was stymied by a couple of quizzes. if i could not answer one question correctly, it meant i could not answer two or three of the next questions, meaning that i could not pass quiz. with no recourse, i was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing. i would still like to pass, as i feel that i really earned the certificate. i would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions. my other problem was using one of the models, which i never could master, despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times.",1
25372,"this is a course almost without any content. you coul pick any book about game design and you will learn more of game design in the first ten pages. i recommend level up! by scott rogers for begginers like me. you could be fooled by this course if you dont know the principles of design and narrative structure, but if you know it you will not find anything of value here, becouse dont explain almost anything about videogame concepts like gameplay, balace, game design, etc. they explain very basics things in the first course and then they forget everything. the rest of the information are very very basic knowledge about character and world design, without being vinculated through metodologies to the games!, only with empty words of inspiration recorded in useles videos. sorry the critics, but i followed all the courses and paid the monoey for the certificate, hoping that some week the course could show somethign usefull. never did. see for books if you want to learn something.",0

98947,"totally unimpressed. video lectures are terrible. explanations are at best incomplete, usually confusing, sometimes incoherent. instructor never gives an overview of the architecture/data flow/structure of active record or action pack, instead describes the syntax of a handful of functions. as a result you only get the most superficial understanding of the material. the graded assignments are just a regurgitation of the lectures and so don't require you to take a deeper dive into the material. in fact, in many cases the answers to the graded assignments are listed in the assignment immediately following the question.",0

16912,if you do not know r studio or r programming this course will be very difficult for you. the fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable. week 2 test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions. their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer.i'm very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because i do not have the time to figure out how to program in r.,0

15194,"it is generally good course, but i feel it is just a combination of very little tools, skills and ideas. i believe it is quite complicate for me to understand, esspecial git and github. i think it is better to combine this course in other courses where you need it.",0

55464,"this course made me understand about machine learning and piqued my interest and more so importantly gave me that confidence that i can further study to deep dive. thanks mr. andrew ng, excellent course. i am recommending this course since then whoever showing an iota of interest in machine learning.",2
56620,this is one of the best machine learning class i have seen. i have see the actual stanford course for this class and the coursera class is very almost the same. this teacher is awesome and really knows his stuff. i use this course as a reference to machine learning. taken it several times,2
29013,"lecturer is really easy to understand, the ways he is using to describe something is understandable, a lot of examples. really like the system of validation, when you need to ""put marks"" for other people to pass assessment.",2
90657,"i have done the first 2 parts and i am half way through the 3rd and i am finding some of the information to be inaccurate. according to the nhs in the uk condom failure rate is 2%, not 15% as stated in this course. it also seems to put a bit too much emphasis on abstinence. i would recommend every one taking this course to do some further research into contraception and find out more accurate information.",1
40798,great course !!!!!! week two is an exceptional lesson on influence.,2
63235,"i understand that this is a project centered course, however i do not feel like i walked away with a solid foundation of what goes into creating synthesizer sounds. sure i learned that i can change parameters within a synthesis program and thereby get various sounds, but that's about all. i was expecting to gain fundamental understanding of the various parameters and what they really do and a more solid understanding of the process of creating custom patches rather then following an example and subsequently making minor adjustments so that it fits my style.",0

90994,"good course about nosql mongodb. i learned a lot about the course but it would have been better if the instructor would have given some emphasis on programming with unix machines like macs. he used windows and in many cases i would run into problems like running mongoid by including gem files that he provided. i had to downgrade from rails 4 to 3 and then to 5, etc hitting stackoverflow every time to sort out technical issues.",1

71499,"i use a lot of java in my current job, but recently had a chance to dip my toes into scala for a recent project. i liked it so much, i decided to take this course to get a little more knowledge of the language.i have to say, i don't think you can get much better of a teacher for an intro to scala course than the designer of the language itself. the course was easy to follow, featured relevant assignments, and was quite useful. at one point, odersky mentions basing the course partially off of sicp and that seemed apropos -- the course was sort of a condensed, scala-based version of sicp.i'm definitely looking forward to taking the next course in the series.",2
19467,"i am very disappointed in this specilization/course. i am working as a business analyst in a data warehouse consulting firm, so i was highly motivated to take all the courses! however, lecturer's poor delivery has taked me aback! it is really hard to grasp the information when it has simply been read to you! the lecturer is always reading and it makes me sick (sorry!). anyway, i would not continue with the courses if nothing changed. in my opinion, if the lecturer respects students and his field of study, he does not read from the script and lack motivation...",0
16943,"the course was interesting, but unfortunately it really felt like it was tailored to a male audience. the metaphors, examples (ie ""surely you've taken part in team sports like american football"") and tone really made it feel like the course was aimed not at me, but at men. as a woman in an industry dominated by men, this was disappointing because i don't believe that i am any less deserving of a place at the top table, but this course made me feel like those kind of jobs weren't for me. i would prefer it if the course leaders would take the time to look at the content of this and other imba courses and ensure that the content takes on a more neutral tone, to make it feel more welcoming to people traditionally shut out of very senior roles",1
19290,"the prof is so good, even an amateur cant help falling in love with the subject",2
12838,not recommend. very basic and videos are only 2 - 3 minutes.,0
93804,"the teacher goes very fast with the concepts without really spending much time on each of them. it will be great if instead of covering all things in short amount of time, the teacher could write r code using each type of function in console so that students know exactly what to expect.",0

96671,not the best tutor but perhaps one of the worst. hard to understand what he's trying to say.,0
8392,"the course was very useful with what knowledge it provides. however, it would be better if there were more hands-on exercises on relevant stuff. the exercises are too easy and boring. tougher exercises should be added and more time should be spent on the hadoop ecosystem part. knowing the history helps but it should not replace more important topics.",1

29302,very well taught,2
72159,"this is a good course to get you thinking about your future classroom. however, do not expect it to necessarily challenge you to think in depth about your practice or provide engaging discussion via the forums.nevertheless, a good way to get you thinking critically about how you want to run your classroom and provide examples and suggestions.",1
72203,"clearly, the instructor is passionate about the beatles (as am i). however it's really hard to talk about the music of the beatles and not nine able to even quote from their songs, much less play their music! no songs, no music for fear of being sued!takes a good deal away from the course!",1
15140,the real basics of data analysis. the course is not bad i would just say it may be too simple even for an introductory course,1
81185,"the course discussed a great deal of very important information, but the instruction was very rushed, and often lacked the specific details needed - for example, formulas were sometimes left out, and it was assumed you could/would just ""figure it out."" the quizzes were very detailed and specific - which i do not disagree with - but i feel as though they sometimes focused on minutiae rather than large or critical concepts.there were also several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the quizzes.",1
9917,"you really need prior coding experience to understand the training. i also was very disappointed in the teaching. we have an incredible opportunity to improve education, and i feel that this course is merely an extension of current learning techniques. it was extremely difficult for me to fully participate without paying. i was using this course to make a specific android app to control my wheelchair. i act as an analyst for my programmer husband. so i fully understand code architecture, but absolutely hate coding by hand. this course glossed over coding however it is far more code intensive then i was led to believe.",0
67089,"the lesson is really boring , and the lecturer just reads the slides. and there is no any interaction on the slides, or explaining on the graphs and meaning of sentence. just read it through. i am enough of this kind of lesson.",0

105500,not very challenging. will be more better if there are case studies in the quiz and we answer questions applying the knowledge from the video lectures to the case studies.,0

1649,a very helpful introduction to business analytics.,2
62941,"disadvantages : lacks rigour, lacks support from instructors , expensive , peer review ( this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good). *** disclaimer *** i am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week.advantages :quick to earn cert, prewritten code available for easy use. assignments on your own data. this is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique.i would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques.this course is not worth paying usd79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money. you can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert.",1
100502,"there was very little actual content in this course, and i can't say i learned very much. in hindsight, i wish i hadn't paid for a verified certificate.",0
48977,"this course is not terrible, i learned a few things, but it is poorly designed.some things are explained as if to people who aren't familiar with the concepts at all, while others are explained as if to people who must already know a lot about the concepts. i often felt lost. the ""quizzes"" did not help, you could do well on them without actually understanding things (i remember one multiple-choice question where the options were something like (a) ""arrhenius's first law"", (b) ""arrhenius's second law"", (c) ""arrhenius's third law"", and you didn't even have to look at the question or know what the law was to know the answer because only one of arrhenius's laws had been mentioned in the course at all).there are two types of videos in this course. in one type, the professor is in a lab or kitchen or classroom or something and is physically demonstrating things. these videos are useful and mostly understandable. the other type of videos are lecture-style things that appear to have literally been sliced out of some other more thorough set of videos - sometimes the professor refers back to ""earlier"" parts of the lecture that we haven't actually seen before. concepts and variables are often introduced without even mentioning what they refer to.",0

10164,"i enjoyed the contents and homeworks. overall the delivery was very good, and i have grasped a lot.the main reason that i won't give 5 stars is the program assignment. i have spent and wasted 3 weeks to work on the tools, yes, tools, not the subject matter. course should clearly indicate that the assignment only works in linux/unix environment, and need to further test the scripts in most popular linux os platforms, different c++ versions, and different python versions.",2
3744,"this is a good introduction course. but!but, i don't think it's worth to pay 61 dollar for a couple of hours of lectures, that you can finish during 1 day.i'm really disappointed with the fact, that it's not possible to go through quizes and assignments without payment. what if i can't pay right now, but will be able to pay at the end to receive my certificate? i should go through the course again and i will be late for all assignments, so will have to wait for another course session... very-very inconvenient.and, yep, coursera reduce the effect of learning with not providing quizes for those who are auditing only.",1
101335,course is helpful as a refresher to econ and business students who took some statistics in college. someone who has never taken such courses will probably find this course much less helpful.,1
19553,"it is too simplified to get a real view of the 90's economic situation , especially the 91-93 years.to talk about transition between a and c , better to talk about a and not only about b and c.it is an useful course for general knowledge of russia , it as a start , for more accurate analyses i could advise this ( in russian) :https://openuni.io/course/2/and thathttps://openuni.io/course/3/",1

59435,"i have tried and tested multiple courses on machine learning. this course's usp is the in-detail theoretical treatment of the machine learning algorithms with a focus on quick prototyping using a simple language such as octave. don't get me wrong - for my purposes, i always prefer python to r and r to octave. r and python might have great ml libraries, but if you wish to get your hands dirty with the engineering behind those algorithms, the build, that is - then octave is great!. i think it's a much needed skill, to understand the design of these algorithms in greater detail. it's a more liberating experience than being reliant on limited degrees of freedom provided by some packages in r or python.",2
39072,"while there were many typos in screenshots and code examples, this course has been a tremendous help to me as i reinforced some things i already knew about javascript and learned new concepts about the javascript language (like coding in events or working with the dom). i definitely feel like a more confident programmer, even though i do wish the instructor could've explained some things in more detail (like when to use the dot attribute notation over the setattribute method).",1

101111,"this course was terribly underwhelming. there is no interaction from the wharton staff, nothing that connects this to anything learned in the specialization, and nothing that even resembles a case study. grades are subjectively assigned on a very narrow grading scale by peers and the format of the assignment doesn't allow for enough explanation to develop a thesis. of any information given to the student is from magazine/newspaper/journal articles without data and we are tasked with identifying a business solution to a problem with little context. very disappointed in this offering. after taking the data analysis specialization offered through duke university i know what a capstone course should be and this course is so far from that it should be removed from the course catalog.",0

9132,this comical man makes me very annoy.,0
60375,"a much awaited end for a very compelling specialization! nevertheless, the work felt a little bit lonely since there was not any input from faculty staff, which led to some unsatisfactory feeling after some peer reviews.other than that, it was a great opportunity to make a very interesting research and analysis in the framework of what we have learn in the topics of microeconomics, macroeconomics and data presentation.",1
2167,"the exercises , quizzes and videos are well planned and help understand the course material.",2
24546,i thought the course was extremely valuable and on point with the type of information i needed to know. i do ask that you keep newbies in mind and some of the videos went a little fast and indepth for newbies to the complete data analytics process. some more basics would also be nice to add.,2

""week"" 4 is 15mins... overall, i felt let down by the lack of materials and assignments (no hand-on experience can be gained, no peer -graded assignments).",0

24185,poor english. unfair assignments ((,0
13473,the material is great; and learning to use shiny and creating an application is a lot of fun.the only complaint i have with this course was it being put into the new coursera platform. i felt like i was beta testing the new platform and that distracted from focusing on the course and the assignments within it.,2

58634,very nice learning and usefull concepts.i do recommend this course.,2
103845,very disappointed. having coding assignments weekly would have been very helpful. the quizzes often asked for information that was never presented in the lessons. the instructors were never present in the forums to answer questions. the final project asked us to do things that hadn't even been mentioned in the course materials. i would not recommend this course to anyone. the only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 was because i did learn some swift.,0
5254,"i loved it very much. easy to understand, visual and enjoyable explanations.",2
26313,"good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated. for example, it doesn't cover the update version of github website and how to use it. that being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing. another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment. it is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for.",1

38728,the videos are very dry and not entirely helpful. the labs are well laid out.,1
99640,the quiz is so frustrating,0
68468,"the instructors are great and the material logically detailed. the only problem is feed back or lack thereof. the assignments are hard for a person who has minimal computer skills as described in the outline, so having someone to go to for questions, especially the programming parts are essential and this is lacking unfortunately. apparently, and i don't want to put words in someone else's mouth, but the assumption is that the fellow students will have the missing information and that they will actually answer them. that is not the case unfortunately. so even though i emailed the instructors with no response, i managed to obtain some information from other student who were extremely dedicated and much more advanced. i may have entered the course at a minimal personnel time which may account for my perceived difficulty. however, from some of the griping, i am not alone. on the other one gets what they pay for and i was overall glad to take the course and respect all the aspects except for the one already mentioned.",1
64896,great from the startdefinitely recommended,2
52119,short videos with lost of good information.,2
93225,the assignments had nothing to do with the lectures. the teachers do a poor job of explaining basic concepts and theories. the class is a lot more advanced than the class description makes it seem.,0

33892,"as an educator myself, i found this class to be rather pathetic in its structure and the assignments. these are topics and activities that i was doing as a student in middle school and junior high (both public schools mind you, not arts centered charters). charging people for a certificate in this ""class"" is tantamount to what diploma mills do as the course requirements are not up to even senior high school level coursework. truly, coursera, what happened to your open education offering real education?",0

13564,"i'm honestly quite pissed. the material itself is fine but i have had a terrible experience working with the instructors. i don't think i will continue taking these courses.i don't appreciate the amount of time and effort given into the programming assignments only to receive practically zero help. first of all, i don't know why i'm failing the test cases, i just am. your program runs through maybe 100 tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructors decide you should only see the first 3. but then, i try posting on the forums to receive help only to have it removed. quite frankly, i have spent well over 10 hours at this point on a single problem and i've created my own tests and i have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forums and i still have no clue what to do. i have school, a job, and yet i'm losing all this productivity because i'm running all these damn tests hoping on the off-chance that i catch whatever weird bug it is that's failing my code. all i want is real, concrete feedback.",0
97600,average. doesn't really like the professor's style. he spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc. i feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy. finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject. i would have prefer a more historical approach. overall i've watched all the content but in the future i won't spend much time checking for new mooc from him. thanks for the try though,1
82507,"it must be taught by someone who can speak english clearly. sorry but i couldn't understand what mercedes paniccia spoke, which made the course even more difficult to understand. there are subtitles but it's not possible for everyone to put that much effort. this issue must be taken seriously to make this mooc much better.",0

3523,"this course covers the basic ground about approximation algorithms and would be very valuable for a practitioner, but seems designed for people who already know the materials and is more theoretical than applied.lectures are very abstract --with a description of the problem and a formal description of the solution--, there are few examples with step-by-step tracing of algorithms --that is how the algorithm actually works to solve the problem--, and a significant amount of expertise is assumed --so much so, that you wouldn't need this course. for example, there are questions about ""approximation ratio"", but it is not explained. this seems like something that is inherent to approximation algorithms, but is only asked in the exams/project, and is not even mentioned in the lectures. similar issues abound around the course.",0

2350,"i am very interested in this topic however i found the instructor's presentation to be so monotonic and slow paced that i dropped out. i am sure he knows his material cold and i am sure that he is much better ""live"" in class. the readings were appropriate and the course out line solid. however this is not his media. and i have done the ""talking to the camera"" thing and it can be deadly for presenters. it is not btw an ""age thing""; i am older than he, i am sure, and do not ask that presentations be entertaining - just that they be engaging. (perhaps if coursera had lecturers present in front of small groups, as ""great courses"" does? it is unfortunate that (as i understand it) coursera doesn't offer a ""free look"" with the option to transfer one's fee to another course if unhappy. hope this is constructive for both the lecturer and coursera.",0

62849,it feels very rushed.,2
42237,"so excited to be continuing through this course. i have already learned so much, and i love how interactive and comprehensive it all is.",2
69292,just great.,2
40804,"exceptional course, very easy to understand and useful in day-to-day basis.i only would suggest to provide additional material to re-inforce understanding, practice and train techniques shown.great material you developed, university of michigan team.regards,carlos",2
487,"thank you so much jeff, iy was usefull course, i think it needs to extend the material and learning's period.thank you so much!!!",2
93130,it is not a beginner friendly course. learn r from somewhere else and then take this course.,1
74512,good basic intro. professor doesn't take himself too seriously which makes the lectures entertaining as well as informative. i would recommend this to someone who has no coding experience.i have some programming experience with python. i didn't need to watch the lectures to answer the questions. there may need to be some way to 'exempt' out of certain courses to get to next course in the specialization.,2
16914,not recommended. not clear why we need to use r and learn all this statistics. not practical for use in ux design.,0
93345,"i am reviewing at very early stage (after 1 week of my study in this course) but i am pleased with the entire flow, management etc of the course so far.swirl is i would say one of the best feature. along with vid-lecs it gives us a perfect opportunity to get our grip on the programming.wish we could have such facility with all such programming environments. :)hats off to all the makers of the arrangements. thanks a lot :)",2
29501,it lacks of video lectures so i had to rely on notes only. the course's content is interesting and has potential to give learner more depth of topics. hope it will be improved soon.,1
18620,final assignment is too difficult to do for beginners. it's crucial for them not to pass the course unless getting a certain score on the final assignment.,0
30142,it was a great help for me to start understanding how to write correctly. i'm gonna definitely start using it!!,2
103942,"went in a slow pace. enjoyed the modules, especially final assignment.",1
58647,good course for learn deep learning.,2
9498,"superb course; it's helped me immensely in learning ap calculus, and it's yet another reason for why jim fowler is such a highly acclaimed mathematician.",2
103952,"probably guys did big amount of work, but the course looks extremely raw. half of lectures time is talking about nothing and it seems that there were no lecture plan before shooting the video. it would have been ok if the course had been free, but i expected much more from it for that price.thank you for you work, but, i think, you need to keep improving the quality of the course.",0
75115,should be a little bit harder,2
97514,"i liked very much the course and i would like to get enrolled in others courses related. it helped me a lot to much better develop my work of inter-faith's dialogue and i think important my institution to include the theme of counterterrorism and foreign fighters at our magazine as prevention to avoid conflicts and wrong decision by youngers. as christian, to better understand the muslim and islam world to promote peace is fundamental.",2
50818,nothing helpful,0
12163,some videos are lively... some questions are unnecessarily hard... the instructor is generous and learned.,2
2347,"if possible, i would give this course zero stars. it provides an incredibly closed minded view towards all topics and provides very minimal factual information. the makers of this course, and especially the instructor, obviously have had very little to no experience of any kind with most of the topics they discuss.",0
25697,a good start for learning game design and development,1
86816,"maybe homeworks are too easy, but they are concentrated on the course...",2
66782,"not as good as the other courses. i do wish another instructor could have done the videos. i had a very hard time staying with this course due to my frustration with instructor style of communicating. i felt like to much basic info about marketing especially traditional vs digital advertising. most of us, get that. i don't know when i've struggled so hard to keep my attention and focus on the material. this specialization starts with a bang and ends very boring and outdated feeling.",0
93889,very superficial and inconclusive.the course professor focuses more on himself than on the material.,0
19128,"the course is a shallow introduction to a set of topics about embedded systems, it tries to cover too much without really explaining the concepts. the videos could have some diagram.",0
58364,"after i took this course, i'm convinced that online learning can actually be much better than traditional education. thank to all coursera founders and andrew ng!",2
63285,great course!,2
8157,good for everyone,2
57944,"excellent broad introduction to machine learning techniques from linear regression to neural networks and beyond. it goes into an appropriate amount of detail without getting bogged down by esoteric mathematics. whether you're new to the field or just filling in gaps, this course fits the bill.",2
17084,same as the theory class not much examples or case studies....,1
93229,i liked the course very much because mr peng has given me very good grounding of the basics of r. i wish to keep learning more about r because this course has certainly motivated me enough to pursue the next course on r. thanks team for having me as a participant. all the best to mr peng :-),2
99119,"very intersting course, using various fields of engineering (mechanics, structures, fluid dynamics, electricty...) and project management. recommanded to have a good overview of wind energy !",2
94500,very little depth. i don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or r. i really didn't learn anything. i mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,0
11110,i did not find that this course added anything to what i already learned. seems mainly a re-hash of prior material slimly disguising marketing pitch of other northwestern courses.,0
87543,i would like to thank dr. charles severance for a very informative and easy to learn material. it was pleasant to go through this course.,2
39647,"interesting from the basics to the (optional) details, taught and brought with fun and passion",2
65294,"at first it turns up a little difficult, especially the second week but it's all there.the community was great, the discussions helped me a lot.",2
69623,"it is a great course!!! for me, it is an excellent opportunity for learning about others languages...",2
47828,"excellent content, well represented.it's been so long since something engaged my mind so much.thanks every body and congratulation to such success.",2
67186,"there is a lot of good information in here that is told poorly. professor simply reads the slides to you for the most part, foregoing practical examples in favor of sticking to abstract concepts, and letting you figure out the details. quizzes had errors in them that made passing them unnecessarily difficult. the slides that you could download are sometimes cutoff, leaving information out. this is very indicative of the classes i had in college, where the class was ""here are a bunch of whitepapers/books, read them, and you'll be an expert"". there is little in the way of helping you understand these complicated concepts, and because they are complicated, many argue that should absolve the professor from needing to find a way to teach them in an understandable way (when other professors have been able to take complicated topics like this and distill it down to something that was both fun to learn and gave a solid foundation for going forward). i'm sure professor hinton has contributed much to the field, but i suspect his passion lies in playing with ideas and theories, not in trying to teach the next generation about how to do so.",0
52843,"i love the content overall. however, i'm very disappointed that there are no video lectures at all. ironically, i could find some old video lectures of this course on youtube. the difficulty of this course warrants video lectures to convey many concepts and techniques, such as the fitch system.hopefully you can add video lectures back to this course.",1
87165,after the first two courses this one seems to be much more difficult. maybe some intermediate course is needed.,2
81854,"i am really disappointed, to be honest! course covers mostly trivial stuff; lectures are just presenting code snippets; many inaccuracies; nothing about html5; entire 4-week-class can easily be completed in one week.definitely not near the quality i am used to from coursera. udacity’s ""intro to html and css"" and ""javascript basics"" are way better.",0
45000,"it`s very interesting, helpful and easy. thank you very much!",2
8420,last exercise is half the course and took many frustrating hours to install and for me never worked. no support provided by instructors. you are on your own.,0
90430,this is a very good course for a begineer like me.,2
33894,"a very good course, not just for those who want to become experts, but also for those who know more.",2
40367,"of course, this course will give a whole idea about the india of contemporary time.",1
12897,this course is not prepared as well. you see several video with animated presentation and typical (vocabulary) terms.it is not for beginners because in course you didn't find answers.it is not for pros because in course you didn't find interesting material.hope that instructors can change course to better.,0
28775,excellent class ! the professor is dynamic and really interesting. thank you !,2
31350,thank you for the course. it was exciting and helpful. i enjoyed it very much and gained m,2
80247,"this course packed a lot in and was very direct and efficient, giving helpful examples to illustrate the points. the project management tools learned can be applied in so many situations even for those of us who will never have the official title of ""project manager"". videos are supplemented by flash lessons that go over the information, which was great for learners who may not learn as well by video alone. i would have liked one or two written assignments, but quizzes were relevant to the information provided and it was nice not to have to wait on peer-reviews. overall, a great course.",2
89456,over reliance on student grading. material does not map well to the quizzes.,0
5755,"the videos and explanations are very poor. most of the time the instructors are reading off a script, and everything feels fake. by reading off a script they are forced to ""hand-wave"" and do not explain concepts covered completely.the only thing i liked about this course were the problem sets, which were interesting to do. will not buy rest of specialization, feels like this is just a cash cow for ucsd.",0
15317,"it is a good beginners course but i think there are better lessons in sas and python if learning these is your goal, and the content in data cleaning and visual analysis is very basic.",1
103943,very poor organized.,0
66579,"this was a thought provoking, tip of the ice-berg, inspiring and simple course appropriate for nearly anyone with an interest in 'the arts'. i will say also that crucial to 'getting' this topic and the most out of the course content you must do the final project. that is where the aha! moment awaits. great course.",2
17347,it was really frustrating that the autograder and assignment instructions didn't match. this course has been around too long for that big of a mistake. the lectures were the redeeming factor. they were interesting and presented the subject matter in a concise way.,1
49994,this course is very basic,1
66940,"it contains the exact combination of neuroscience, psychology and economics that a student with no clinic background was searching for",2
4849,i found it very hard to understand the lecturers and what they were saying.,0
68760,poorly executed. constant differences in data. tiresome to watch two supposedly very intelligent instructors amuse themselves by saying bro and dude. the use og graphlab is unnecessary and adds a layer of complication which adds no future value to your toolkit. probably a lot of better executed machine learning courses out there,0
11875,a good course but neither notes nor lectures were not in much details. but still it was worth my time. i strongly recommend it if you want a subtle introduction to bayesian statistics.,2
32935,"one of the best teacher that i have ever seen in my life, accessible and understandablematerials. in short, the best!!!",2
103644,super boring & clinical presentation of the material.,0
30432,it's a good course with some interesting resources. most of the practice resources use flash and one of the assignment submissions is inconsistent with the other submission formats. the content of the course itself is 4.5 stars. for me there is one element that i wish had an explanation or somewhere to ask about it. instead i'll need to search the internet for an answer and hope what i find is correct!,1
32807,great course for anyone interested in how to make cities a more sustainable and pleasant place to live.,2
79508,one of the best courses ever in music production!,2
4586,the instructions are excellent. it really helps to learn the analytical functions in excel,2
30651,"great course, the lessons are very well explained.",2
13716,"the peer reviewed assignments are next to useless, as there is no oversight on them. i think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first, before allowing fellow learners the ability to pass/fail students in the course.",0
104331,could have gone more deeper in some of the topics which were covered at very high level. overall a good introduction to the subject matter.,2
37742,"it is two hard for beginners, or the lectures should be more detailed because assignments are hard. and on the another hand there are two much information and lectures for one week. it should be less lectures and information for one week. in this way it has two much load for person who works. it should be stretched trough more then 3 week for example 6 weeks with less lecturers with assignments that are graduly get difficult. because first assignment is to big jump.",0
24774,maybe a little thin in terms of content; besides interesting,1
20350,"a mathematical and, to a lesser extent, a programming and standards (itu) perspective of digital signal processing. if you have solid maths skills and are comfortable on the complex plane this excellent course is well worth the time and effort.",2
60836,brief and accurate course. it provides useful information for writing professional emails. it´s a pity that the free version does not include assignments and peer´s review.,1
45652,"some very interesting topics, that are presented sufficiently well to actual",2
46459,"covers helpful and interesting tools that will be of interest to anyone with a desire to learn.well presented, with useful optional videos to provide further context.",2
5677,"the programming exercises should not be optional. i still intend to do them, but now i passed the course with a 100% mark but only 10% of knowledge.",0
94203,"very shallow content - broad, but not deep. not many assignments instead of the last one. we hear what we heard before. for the same price, analytics edge at edx is far better choice for practical machine learning.",0
52472,"a) there clearly was a huge amount of criminal behavior that contributed to the crisis. the presenters appear to approach the subject half-heartedly, and focus their energies on disproving the possibility without sufficiently examining it.b) a lot of the review questions focus on remembering facts rather than on understanding the causes and effects. for example, what is the relevance of being able to remember that job losses at the height of the crisis were of the order of 880k a month or 200k a month??c) it is obvious to anyone with even trivial financial expertise that the financial system today is weaker than it was before the crisis. the too big to fail are bigger today (by a large margin) and interest rates are too low (remember the search for yield was the motivation for the creation of the exotic securities which blew up the system). secy geithner's focus in week 8 comes across as a personal defence of his actions rather an objective analysis of what was done and should have been done.",0
75507,"this course is way too slow and boring. i am disappointed i have paid so much for so few content here. why a full specialisation cycle when one or two courses would probably have been more than enough ? too much distraction as well, with ""funny"" videos that i had to pay for...",0
22028,"the course is good, but it doesn't really offer all the tools required to pass the exams. i had to take extra courses in other place in order to pass. in addition, the exams some times become a bit too subjective of what the classmates want to grade you.",1
29359,excellent course. very well presented.,2
104826,"brian caffo is explaining the statistical inference methodically, but he could work on making the lectures less tiresome and monotonous.",1
87860,"another in an excellent series of python courses. thanks for making the videos shorter, it's hard to download stuff here in southeast asia.",2
60988,"the subjects selected are relevant, the professors are very knowledgable, engaging and inspiring and they answer all the questions promptly.i enjoyed this course tremendously, highly recommended!",2
93659,"there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos, which is fine, and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audience.to solve these problems i have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for help.i agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing, but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practice.you can't slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand (much harder than anything seen during class) and expect me to do it in 5 hours per week. maybe 5 hours per day.disappointed. i wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but i will most likely try to get back the money i spent on this and let it go.",0

38684,java for android was everything i expected. the lectures and assignments were very clear. the instructors and mentors were very helpful. i am looking forward to the next class.,2
19266,this is a very unevenly paced and constructed course - not at all delivered to the standard of the previous coursera courses i have followed. some lectures are clear and guide the learner step by step - and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concepts that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail. it also ends up focusing more on music analysis than music theory - while there is a relationship between these 2 approaches i did not embark on this course to become an analyst - as a practising musician i wanted to understand more of the concepts behind what i do and hear. very disappointed - i will now look elsewhere to satisfy my learning.,0
85396,genius. marvelous. astounding. i have no more words.,2
92863,"there is a wide gap between the videos, practice assignments and completing the required projects.",1
3246,"extremely poor help and feedback.almost no replies on discussion forums from mentors/peers so many issues end up unresolved. considering how difficult this course is compared to other courses, the lack of real assistance is appalling.seemingly outdated lessons.a lot of errors i get come from version discrepancies. lessons should be checked over. if i have to google problems to complete step-by-step lessons, the lesson is extremely ill-prepared.this is enough to make me abort this specialization.",0
10396,its very boring. just someone reading off slides. one could read from a book instead. no examples or explanation to the information on the slides.,0

73037,"initially, i took the course just for general interest in typography. the nice experience i made here convinced me to go deeper into the material in the future. i definitely learned something that took me some steps forward.i especially liked the well-made videos. they are very good to listen to and they are very clearly designed, it is making things easy to understand.in the exams and in the peer reviews, it seemed to make a difference that some students had already taken the graphics design specialization.i can definitely recommend this course.",2
92504,amazing lectures in a valuable way of sharing knowledge. the business cases brought as examples were very well selected and made the course even more interesting.,2
99611,too basic and superficial.,0
93669,"only the most basic of instructions for r, which are bland and easily read in the documentation or other free resources. there are very few best practices or real examples to use anything found within. the quizzes and assignments do not match the lecture material and are contrived. not worth the money!",0
34498,"the course was great but there were some quality issues; such as incomplete instructions in week 3 quizzes and some errors in numbers. and the formula bars in the videos (i.e. formulas within the spreadsheets) were immensely small and we could not see the formulas therein. participants raised this several times in the discussion forum but there was no response from the instructors. though the course content itself was excellent, the rating is because of the issues mentioned. otherwise the course was great and i would recommend it to others for the knowledge.",1
3165,this course is not for javascript beginners. you should come in with solid understanding of the language - probably more than you would get from the first two courses of this program.,1
54178,this course helps me to know the basic things of machine learning and help me to prepare for deep learning course.,2
37,excellent overview of the ways in which 3d printing is in use and how it may be used in the future.,2
76577,"to be honest, i thought the course stumbled and fell short. it was too basic and slow paced. the tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroom--not something for working professionals. and it's certainly not mature enough or challenging enough for a university class. even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience, it could accomplish that while providing more content, and making the content relevant.is the course worth the price? hell no. if you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end. the entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes. one would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.i'm not sure about the value of the videos titled ""office hours."" they all appeared as self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great i am making this video in paris."" they're really nothing more than that. in one video, he corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brush-off: ""other people here would like to talk with me too."" after all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did severance make me watch that?"" ""what was the point?"" and you'll shrug your shoulders and say, ""another waste of time.""",0
10776,"the capstone, just like the courses of the specialization are a strong illustration of the problems of higher ed.",0
2913,"many of the problem sets ask you to apply theorems in ways that have not been demonstrated. if a student makes a mistake, no feedback is given other than, ""that is not the right answer"".",0
9375,"really frustrating method of teaching. class is incredibly slow and does way, way too much simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication to prove extremely basic points for a calculus course.",0
67205,"the pedagogy in this course is truly horrible. it is severely lacking concrete relevant real world examples - in the beginning of each lecture would be super - motivating each technique. this is kind of a dealbreaker. furthermore the material is really dry and theoretical, lacking pragmatic problem solving. imo way too much time and energy is wasted on history, name-dropping and dry mathematical backrounds. andrew ng of stanford university, with his course ""machine learning"" is a great example of how it can and should be done.suffice to say it would be much more smoth, fun and efficient to start with 1) current real world relevant problem(s) motivating the technique, then 2) a clear description of the technique - with concrete examples mapping the theory to practice. this last part is super important and is what is lacking the most in the course. one more thing, the quizes and questions makes alot of silent and weird assumptions, often not even clearly relating to the lecture materials. there are also technical bugs and missing images in the quizes. suffice to say this is a real dealbreaker.",0

38677,"now that i have completed the course i'd like to give some feedback on how i think it was.1. quizzes are horrible. the fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful. there are only 3 quizzes where i missed just one question but no matter what, i can't get them correct. it would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something. also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesn't have any programming experience i think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer. i have a programming background and out of all the quizzes i just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but i've been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and i just can't get them right. if there was feedback after taking a quiz i'm sure it would of helped. for those 3 quizzes, i took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and i just keep trying to get that one right. it's not helpful and then it turns into a ""just keep selecting different things until it's right"" thing instead of understanding it.2. the course says it's for beginners to programming but i beg to differ. i think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out i do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that week two ascii assignment. i thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons. maybe it's because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #33. i do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students. there are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an ascii art example. because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic. i think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course. some of the things explained in the lessons i would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.4. some material is not consistent. like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the account code example, you never really mention the mout or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (the course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when you're working with the account example files5. it seems this course really isn't fully developed yet and is still going through it's growing painsoverall, i would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of java. for me, since i do have some java experience and a programming background it wasn't too bad, but i'm thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before. i just don't think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.i really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background",1

80517,this course disappointed me. i expected to receive knowledge about negotiation. but it's more advertisement for the book. i did every step in the course until the quiz and the quiz asks for knowledge which wasn't in the course. i assume that i should have read the book to be prepared to do the quiz. that's not why i registered on coursera.,0

24447,"the course provides a very thorough introduction on the basic models and mechanisms by which various financial products are priced. one issue i had, was that the quiz questions sometimes used terminology or jargon for which the link with the material covered in the videos was not always immediately obvious. also, the course, especially the later modules, heavily relies on microsoft excel, which some people might not be willing to pay hard cash for. it is possible to pass by doing the assignments with e.g. python, but it's a lot of work, and not for the faint of heart.",1

19473,"i took onus with a number of ideas/concepts offered, simply because they are either misrepresentative of sm or untrue. first, the the ""prof"" who talked about visuals overplayed the role of visuals online. the internet began as a text communications vehicle, not a medium to share graphics (etc). the rise of video, images only grew as the technology evolved to allow easy distribution. words are still key online--are there any websites major who do not use words? in fact, for many of the good ones, visuals take a secondary role to the actual written content. second, the section about joining a community and then faking your way to gaining credibility by posing as a newbie etc--especially by marketers--is highly reviled by many sm communities. as an influencer who has been approached by many marketers in the past decade ""to help them understand something"" (etc) i can tell you, we do suss you out quickly and treat you appropriately. we are not here to provide free consulting to make you feel or look competent or knowledgeable (as we would for real members of a community). i contacted a friend who's an influencer in different communities to me, with what your ""expert"" suggested. he, too, was not happy with what was in this unit. if you want to know why marketers have a bad rep? it's because of bad advice given in webinars like this one. i am so glad i did not pay for this course.",0

103993,"very disorganized. more than a course, it seems more like 2 students learning along with you. the lessons have 0 preparation and they come up with examples that do not work half of the time during the video itself. i do not recommend this course (and as a matter of fact, the entire specialization) to anyone.",0

88889,"a good course. however, i would expect more coherence between the different modules discussed. in its current structure, the course represents a glance at an arbitrary selection of several topics (unrelated to e, existing in today's philosophy, rather than a coherent introduction into the broad discipline of philosophy. however, this may be just a matter of approach - this approach is also perfectly valid.",1

95450,"a course which has great assignments. however, the video itself is a bit boring. most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments.at the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with python, but for me it's just ok. what i want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the autograder is so rigid that i have to try one question over and over again until the autograder ""feels happy"", and for me, sometimes the gap between ""correct answer"" and ""incorrect answer"" isn't so large...and finally, thank you, teacher christopher brooks! you are ateacher full of passion, and i actually learnt a lot from you and your course.",1

(i'm also a web/js developer, so i'm used to intense struggles with really abstract stuff.)what i can't get over is that this is part of an interaction design specialization that teaches design concepts, but whose instructors almost never practice those concepts in their pedagogy. ""do as i say, not as i do"" seems to be the prevailing mo. the whole effort seems totally half-baked, and nowhere more so than in this course.i might not be so harsh if there weren't such great examples of well designed pedagogy elsewhere in coursera, and for material that's at least as dry as statistics.",0
98081,"a very comprehensive introduction, well structured and narrated. video lectures were interesting and easy-to-follow. i liked the fact that ted talks and other video sources were used in the syllabus. also, the course book is well written. my only addition to it would be to include more solution-based topics.",2

13176,the course is informative. the lecturer uses comprehensible language and examples.,2
81566,a good basic course for positive psychology. really like the panel discussion and the interactive questions. do find it is a bit too basic for people who are in the psychology field. but recommended for people who want an introduction to positive psychology.,1

89071,i found the course a little hard to follow mainly because the video lectures would not load. i found i spent more time trying to get the course material working than actually absorbing it.i really liked the lectures once they were working though. its a very nice introduction to a way of thinking and the examples used to argument the theories were very entertaining.,1

35952,"an excellent course for those who know more.very well presented, quite easy to understand.",2
18853,i was interested in this course but as it stands it is more like marketing hype than a proper course. for one thing it tries to cover far too much material in 4 weeks. within the limited scope of the beta test i started the node red stuff. it looks easy but the lecturer didn't make it clear what it was for anyway.a much more thorough introduction should have been given to everything.the lectures on the rasberry pi were a joke. in order to do the course within 4 weeks i would have had to order a rasberry pi before getting to these lectures. a clear guide to course prerequisites and the rasberry pi and sensehat must be provided.neither of the tutors seem very happy about their job. this is a small point and not a show stopper.overall - don't issue this course without major revisions (perhaps a new course team).,0
22164,"practical information you can put to use right away. this class was fun and easy. it's an 8 week long course, but finished within 2 weeks. it's not really time consuming, so i definitely recommend anyone who's not too financially savvy to give this course a go!",2

100213,"this is a very short, but useful and highly practical course. it will help you think about your work habits, as well as introduce you to an array of tools to analyze and make changes in whatever areas in your work or personal life you believe should be more productive/fulfilling. it's very light on the theoretical aspect, but it does offer you some food for thought. and ms. meloni is a delightful instructor -- she actually makes you wish the presentations were a lot longer than they are.",1
69856,"great overview of many models and techniques, but very high level. would have greatly benefited from links to resources to learn more about all the subjects. this course leaves students with only basic knowledge of the subject matter, which is fine considering the course timeline. but, for those who want to explore further please recommend sources of additional reading and research.",1
100505,"course content was great, but i felt like the course left me hanging....",1
644,the lectures are just videos of the professor bloviating about jefferson. there is nothing academic about this course.,0

7807,touches on multiple subject matters pertaining to food. simplified in a thorough manner.,2
69975,i could say this is one of the most useful courses that i ever take!.as the last one fsk 'til now it has been an amazing experience.,2
69951,very good basic course. the printouts are a tremendous help.,2
72553,"there are two frustrations with this iteration of the series. one: the quiz questions are often opaquely worded. instead of being tested on the material just learned, it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions.2 and the most glaring omission, was that when students are asked to provide functions, only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly. if the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then you're moving forward blindly after that. then add the quiz questions from problem one above, and you're just wasting your time after that and building up frustration. validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers don't practice it themselves, there are bound to be problems.i like the intent of the course, and considering my outsider background to computer science, the mathematics etc, i did learn a fair bit. not enough to justify the increasing frustration i was feeling toward the end of this course. i have no intention of taking any more at this point, not from these authors.",0
31273,great course so far. the videos are great and the amount of time needed to go through the course is perfect for working professionals.,2
83352,"excellent teaching, but it's not actually free. you must pay in order to access the assignments and the professor's in-browser python sandbox.",0
90532,i felt this course could have been added as sections to other courses. one separate course for this topic is a waste of money.,0
81866,"a little bit more depth wouldn't hurt. i'll check also other courses in this specialization, so if this is just gentle introduction and then later courses goes deeper in the material, then fine, but if they keep the same difficulty level, then... hmmm",2
36506,"bad course, a lot of talking but no explainantion. non of the math is explained. and that is themajurity of the questions that come back in the tests",0
72854,i really got a lot of the course. the material is explained very well. the programming assignments helped further the understanding. the recap video that summarizes the entire module in 10-15 min is also very good.,2
52847,"probably a very interesting course, but the way of teaching looks very indigestible... no video and no real explanation or examples.",0
65841,very interesting and objective class. i think i will take it again because i learned so much about something i needed to study a bit. also it is shot so well! and i love the bibliographies… they may be a favorite of mine...,2
752,"actually, the course should be titled as ""introduction into macroeconomics"", i think. the course is fine, but i won't call it really ""advanced"" one. the structure and topic list is okay, but the depth is not enough to threat the course as ""advanced"".",1
3216,there are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his/ her own interest. what a waste of time .,0
22925,a great course for fluid power,2
8458,less useful than reading an introductory chapter. being able to reiterate acronyms or idiosyncratic mnemonics does not demonstrate any real understanding of this field. the minimal information provided and low level of the instruction at least clarified that this specialization is not worth pursuing.,0
41949,"the content is interesting but the professor is bad at lecturing (lack of structure, some rambling).",1
16160,"needs to structured a bit better.answers to discussions if provided will be very helpful and help analyse situations in the way instructor aims to.the mit case readings, not 10min things, thos cases are all like 20 pages+!",1
68996,so far it has been awesome.,2
98194,good class to attend to learn about types of conflict.,2
13590,thanks so much,2
93524,this course does not teach thoroughly. there is no direction or lead in to best practices.,1
25071,this is one of my favorite courses since it encourages creativity and really contributes to good game design practices.,2
52346,"the lectures are much better than module 1 but still too thin on information required to complete the final assignment. i probably spent 30 hours in all completing the assignment because i had to spend so much time looking up material that was not covered in the lectures. a lot of my time got wasted since it is very difficult to figure out the syntax/structure of the language from the very skimpy lectures &/or the very technical apple documentation.also, not once did the instructors participate or respond to the forum discussion so it was not a surprise that the forum was barely used at all.i am stuck with soldiering on with the next 2 modules since i pre-paid for the specialisation but really i am very disappointed with what i am getting for a paid course.",1
55416,this course is totally worth your time. professor ng is brilliant and his teaching method is absolutely excellent. i really expect to take his real courses.,2
17301,"this course probably deserves 3-4 stars in a better, maintained form, but the entire specialization is not maintained, the lectures have no production values. basically, it's a money pit that coursera is keeping up cynically. it's a real shame because the syllabus correctly addresses a gap in most data scientists' skills.",0
90816,assignments for week 3 and 4 were very tough and a little guidance was provided on how to do the coding part. but since i'm interested in the course i'm re-enrolling to complete it this time.,0
36411,it's quite clear and interesting explanation with some historical background of the derives. just sometimes it's a little bit long time to explain a theory instead of an intense explanation due to the sync with a real class.,2
62092,good i learned a lot of things,2
5645,the submission system for submitting assignments in most of the cases does not work.,1
82160,"i have followed 2 courses at the same time: this one and ""html, css and javascript"". they are covering the similar topics but this class has fallen short on most of the subject.lecture time is very little. short videos, and few of them. each video is mostly non-focused talking, very few examples and so you don't learn much.by comparison, the other class has a lot of videos, each video is much longer and goes into many examples. time is spent on focusing on the things to learn, and you get a lot out of it.i am dropping out of this specialization and will follow the other one which i hope will bring good content (unfortunately the following classes are not from the same teacher but from the same university). the following classes from this specialization are from the same teacher, so i don't think things will improve much.",0
68137,this specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! don't give them money!,0
96739,"although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. all the parts are equally important. you have to carefully go through hours of instructions.each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. this causes a lot of confusion.peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. after submitting my work, i discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.",1
91632,"i felt that weeks 1-4 went at a reasonable pace, but the week 5 material was rushed. those programs were written by the instructor and presented quickly as examples, but some of the content in the programs was not already known or presently explained, like the ""buffer"" built-in function (found in chapter 3 of dr. chuck's book but not covered in the course) and the ""pass"" keyword, which i had to find in the python reference manual for an explanation. the week 5 programs were quite advanced and i would have liked more time spent on explaining them and perhaps a related programming assignment or two to help us learn the material.",1
8830,"very basic, i hoped for a more advanced level.",0
33790,hate auto grading. overall good basic course.,1

81637,"really a good course for people who suffers a lot in modern society. some ways to cultivate positive emotions on this course really help me a lot. and the most important thing while learning this course is to practicing and applying it into reality, which is really amazing~~",1
24904,it's quite simple and doesn't show specific steps of how to do it.,1
98204,effective but could be more detailed.,1

40628,perfect,2
83548,"instructor, dr. chuck, is terrific. however, assignments are incredibly difficult. you are supposed to spend no matter than a few hours a week on the course. i spent over 100 hours alone on the assignments. the mentors that are supposed to help you did not help at all. very poorly put together second module that does not prepare you to complete the assignments",0
90381,way too shallow and way too english :(,0
50747,very good course content and great instructor !,2
37065,i loved this course! it presents the contents in a very simple way. it teaches the necessary to keep advancing on the second course of the specialization (which i highly recommend).,2
100768,"hifirst of all i just want to write i have a background in mechanical engineering and i know the working principles of solar cells quite well. i just wanted to check out this course.i started this course but i find that it is very difficult to concentrate. i tried pinpointing exactly what the problem was and i came up with following:there is too much talking and not enough going on visually. i know you have a person in front of a white screen, and a few visual effects such as floating words and diagrams. it is just not working for me. i have a hard time remembering what you said. i can pause and go back again which is always nice but the info still doesn't stick. this especially true for the lca part, which i don't even think is a difficult concept to grasp.i think the best courses i have seen online is not particularly rehearsed and it is usually just a guy, with a pen, running you through some examples to illustrate the working principles. afterwards they do an everyday life example. i find that these courses always help me a lot.i am sorry about the 2 stars but i hope you see it as a room for improvement. it is probably a first time for you guys to use an online platform as a media so it will take a couple of iterations to get it right.i did like when you illustrated isc and voc in terms and abbreviations. more stuff like that, possibly also with an electrical diagram etc and som flow analogy.if i can propose anything it would be to organize it a bit more like michigan universitys python learning series. i think it is quite good and the assignments are also challenging but you learn a lot.anyway thanks a lot for the course. i hope you will find a way that works.",0
101202,very simple and basic ideas of growing a business. case studies are a little bit outdated.,1
33157,the last assigment is not specific enough for me.,2
89443,mechanically it worked pretty well. just a little hard to figger out what's going on and what's important. what needs to be memorized and what just needs to be understood . . .,1
69038,too easy,1
72581,rather elementary and slow-moving for my taste. but the material is competently presented and covers the material it is advertised to cover.,1
79248,"the course material was quite boring. i have gained some theoretical knowledge about problem solving and decision making techniques, but we weren't given enough practical examples on how we should apply these techniques at work. i wish the lecturer had t suggested additional material on the topic.",0
41421,it is a good course for starters.,2
88373,"it is indeed a good course, especially because of learning about unix and the gpio pins. i missed reading material, since the videos are too short for learning something in a deep way.",1
95920,frequent and forced peer reviews with no opportunity to complete once deadline is missed makes this course nu-necessarily difficult for people with conflicting schedules and responsibilities.,0
8380,very boring,0
22373,easy to undersstand,2
48849,"this mooc has great, engaging and clarifying content. the presented concepts, tools and techniques by professor leigh thompson were of great help and immediate application. i felt like buying each of recommended book in order to dive deeper in each of these exciting subjects.thanks a lot, kellog -northwestern university and coursera. ;)",2
532,i am dropping this course. don't e-mail any more for this course. how do i unroll in this course.,0
2188,"this is a great course, one of the better ones in the series.",2
79492,"pretty decent class but zero communication. if i could give that part a negative score i would, actually an imaginary number would be better. there are a few incorrect lecture links and errors on tests that have been pointed out dozens of times over several years now and nothing has been done whatsoever. was also horribly misleading by stating that it was certificate-granting when it was not, partially (not totally) fixed now but it really screwed one person i know, luckily the grade sheet seems to be sufficient proof for my purposes but if you are looking for resume material go elsewhere. for pure passive learning i would give 4.5 stars, but the lack of any instructor interaction at all, and the obvious lack of attention to consistent (and totally correct) calls to fix simple errors for years now,drags it down to 3 stars in my book. still not bad as long as you know what you are going into. i did learn a decent amount, can't deny that at all, but don't expect even the tiniest effort from anyone to help you with anything under any circumstance.",1
22897,the labs are not up to date and several things do not work as they should. i had to fix several of the provided scripts to finish them.,0
101521,i liked the course because of its format and material. basically it was comprehensive.i did not like the presentation and lack of practical examples. i had to force myself to concentrate at times and search other sources for more detailed insight.,0
13376,i didn't learn many data science concepts in this class,0
31891,"great course, learned a lot from this simple course.covered a lot of interesting ideas about theatre",2
45546,"interesting course and worth doing. could be completed in a day or two if you're just viewing the videos and answering the quiz.positives: the content is interesting and it gives you plenty to think about, and a decent grounding to go away and learn more if you decide to.negatives: first week doesn't add much. the videos are awkwardly delivered and the analogies are a bit contrived.overall, a good primer before moving onto other courses, as it could plant a few new ideas that will be valuable.",1
90170,"extremely basic.the assignments would be easy except that the provided code has bugs, and some of the assignment details are wrong, making it very difficult to pass the test cases.there is also very little information on how the work will be graded.",0
24525,"overall, this is a good course. it provides many handy tools, frameworks, techniques for data-driven decision making process. it does improve my decision making skill. however, the course is quite short and doesn't have much in-depth content.",1
49425,not good as this topic was not taught in great depth. for beginners it is good.,1
19446,good course,2
85440,questions seem geared towards school children. having ridiculously obvious answers in multiple choice is an insult and i now think i've wasted my time doing this course as your accreditation will mean nothing to business in the future if you are just giving accreditation away so easily.,0
51526,very well explained. i think the professor is very good. but i expected to dive a little more in some details.,1
47384,wonderful course,2
30636,"i couldn't finish it without purchasing it, in spite of active participation and high scores on all the assignments i had access to.",1
79331,"this was not really a course, but a person talking in front of camera some jibber jabber and not much to learn from these talks at all. if this was a way for kimberley to increase her brand presence it did not go well. talks were short with no real matter in them fill with jokes just to make time with them. i am sorry i did wait until the last lecture hoping that something will come out of it.",0
73703,awesome course. i know a number of programming and scripting languages but never had been to a class. this is a brilliant course designed and executed with an entirely different note which i could never expect.along with python this course teaches a lot. this python series a must for anyone who wants to learn programming.thanks dr. chuck.,2
22240,this required nearly no effort and is probably of little value in the real world.,0
26174,i like making game after this course!,2
8912,an excellent course. i recommend everyone who is working to take it.,2
14572,"a really interesting course, and also, basic and simple. the lectures are a little fast though. i hope i would continue this course if i have time.",2
89352,"it does not cover the details in some aspects, but overall it is a quite helpful course for python beginner.",2
5471,the professors know what they are doing but not good at making the concepts plain to the students who don't have the strong background. most of the times i would just ask myself why they did this and that but later they don't provide enough explanations.,0
76911,"i have some background in programming (not advanced), so some of this was review, but it is a great introduction to the world of programming, for anybody--as long as you have the interest, this is the place to start!",2

24993,make it more interective,1
100540,amazingly presented.,2
59696,can have a more math background for those who are interested,2
51098,"overall this course has covered a lot of good and interesting information! i found the presentation to be lacking somewhat as the course-leaders were reading off the info in front of the camera, which gave the lectures an artificial sort of feel. i did enjoy the different interviews along the way, which spiced things up a bit. the grading of this course needs to be revised, in my view, as some things will go amiss when students grade each other. all in all it's clear that a lot of work has gone into this course, and that is definitely to be commended by all involved.",1
92768,"the ask in the fist assignment was not formulated correctly. felt the class needed more hands on learning. although the lectures were clear and concise, going back to them really didn't help me with the assignments.",0

18277,"the course focused so much in interacting with images instead of the html, css and js subjects",0

104325,"the difficulty level of this course is very inconsistent. the first project (stack smashing) was difficult, at least for me, but i could complete it with the information taught in the lectures. i was unable to complete the second project (badstore.net), which requires a knowledge of html and sql that is not taught in the course. the third project (fuzzing and symbolic execution) was a joke: ""type this and tell us what you see."" my advice is if you are a novice, take the free course first to see if you can complete it. then, if you really need the certificate, pay and retake the course.",0

51972,"a great course and fully packed with interesting information about different methodologies thought time. wouldn't give it 5 stars because most part during the video lectures are just silly and although i know the professor is trying his best to convey an idea, it seems like there are moments it just drifts away from the point. also, the ""angel x devil"" debates are equally silly, opposite to the following overview video which is excellent. i'd recommend everybody to take this course but i certainly wouldn't do it again and neither dowload the videos for future reference.",1
90141,"prof. taylor's lectures were clear and easy to understand. the course taught the basics of planning pretty well.the teaching staff, unfortunately, was completely unavailable. the solution checkers for the matlab assignments were very brittle and wasted a lot of students' time. there were several queries about the assignments on the discussion forums most of which did not elicit any response from the teaching staff. the students ultimately figured it out by spending several laborious hours figuring out the peculiarities of the solution checkers, and by helping each other. this certainly soured my experience with the course.",0

82336,"the production of this course could be much clearer and as such this is a very tedious course. the actual subject matter is good if you have some experience with javascript. the video is constantly switching between the professor and the code. as such, you'll find yourself constantly replaying certain parts to see what is typed. in some instances, the code is actually ""off-screen"". is there really any value to seeing the professor (rather than just hearing)? the key information is in the code! either leave the video on the code the entire time and run the audio for the teacher, or, add another window where the live code is visible the entire time. it's important that this is the live code. simply providing the final product doesn't allow the novice user to see how it is built.",1
4280,"it is best to have a strong statistical background before taking this course. lots of statistical calculations and procedures. if you don't have a strong background in statistics , there is a good chance you will get lost at some point in the course. there is no questions that the instructor of this course is an accomplished mathematician, i just found it hard to follow his lectures as he got deeper into various statistical aspects of the course.",0

98575,"great course and a very friendly professor :) however there were some mistakes here and there, which are annoying because you do not expect a professor to make such mistakes. furthermore there could be more up to date, data. especially data on energy use etc should not be from the year 2004 if we are in 2017. overall though a biiiiiig thank you!",2

104240,incredibly vague and hand wavy. i didn't feel like i had to write anything down.,0
45711,"i learned a lot from this class. this is not only a class that give you a right way to learning, handle your procrastination, the secret of memory, but also show you the scientific evidence. if a scientist tell me that the procrastination is not a big deal, i will believe that more than just somebody tell me. also, this class gave me the passion and confidence to learn something new.",2

97263,"just a normal online course, the instructors are just reciting their ppt and prepared materials. pretty boring.",1
76523,this class is easy to understand and the tutor is very cute.,2
65093,an excellent introduction to ruby and rails!,2
52973,i really enjoyed the course. professor is very clear and schematic and really passionate on the topic. the studying material is very organized. one improvement could be inserting another week-module in order to slowdown a bit the lecture pace.,2
41240,"good course with varied content and i very much liked the way it was build up (individual, business, cities, nations). reason why i rated it 3 stars (only) is that the course was too easy - however i'm a sustainability professional. maybe the word ""introduction"" can be taken into the title - as the course would serve as a good intro-course for practical application of sustainability.geoffrey (the netherlands)ps: the videos of the parkers can be deleted from my point of view",1
21238,the course covers very limited subset of plots and mostly oriented to r-specific technical routines rather than overall approaches. case-study example is helpful and contrary to the most comments i do appreciate the final course project: this how most problems are stated in real life. if you would like to cover more fundamental concepts behind exploratory analysis i would recommend other sources.,1
60347,"great course. the content is explained clearly, with just basic prerequisite knowledge.",2
11365,i recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their english.,2
15015,"loved the format, i did find that in some cases i did need to use google and stackoverflow to get some answers forcing me to learn the subject. overall i enjoyed my first coursera class.",2
69685,great course to get to familiar with mandarin... it will give you the confidence to start practicing.,2
26656,i loved the way prof. chaikin taught us in this course. absolutely a fan of prof. chaikin and his teaching methodology. this is the best course so far in my experience to learn web-development from the scratch.,2
8288,no technical support is provided for vm issues.,1
79199,simple and clear explanations to solve problems.,1
91416,"while i found this to be a helpful course, some of the most helpful 'walk throughs' were imbedded in bonus videos. would like to have been able to easily access slides in a pdf format since there was so much info on each. there were less lectures and more slides than expected.",2
72762,course materials are well organized. it could be improved by adding more description.,1
61573,the lesson is informative but the course professor does not share value on each slide. she's reading each point and does not provide additional insight.,1
39640,excellent class and the information was presented clearly and the comments from guests were great.,2
44775,"this course does not teach a specific subject, but the skills are applicable to every subjects. useful!",2

97240,"some very good explanations, especially by michel girardin. some other courses lack explanations.",1
63186,"the course was overwrought in general - seemed like it could have been accomplished in four weeks instead of five. the instructor was clear most of the time, but there were places were the concepts were unclear, probably 80 percent was on target. this might explain the inconsistent grading of written assignments. needs some fine tuning, but worth the time.",1
33914,"i loved it , going straight to the point and has very valuable tips",2
24941,"sorry to say that this is the worst coursera course i have ever taken, and i've taken quite a few. the instructors did not do a good job at explaining how to use wordpress. they didn't explain how to use wordpress to make a website that looked more like a website than a blog. they didn't explain the difference between wordpress.com and wordpress.org even though they mentioned them both. they talked about hosting but didn't explain how to do it. they mentioned hosting on bluehost but didn't give any instructions. the few tidbits of information that they did give about using wordpress were so brief with no examples. they mentioned jetpack but didn't say what it was. they didn't explain what benefit adding the social media icons would have or how to link them. and on i could go.the only good part about this course was the last section where they had guest lecturers, some from coursera - those were all excellent.",0
16743,severe lack of support (zero) from the professor or tas. some wrong solutions were provided for assigments but were never addressed or acknowledged that it will be fixed. some assignment files are not mac friendly or is just not viewable by all students (i can't tell). materials are quite good but grading is subject to broad interpretations and there is no human to provide guidance on what are the best practices. to think that i paid for the specialisation in order to take the graded assignment and i have to do the grading but i do not receive support? this is ridiculous. i will have to think three times before i pay for a coursera course in the future. never again. i will not recommend this to others.,0
4428,this course was over my head academically and i was able to glean very little from it.,1
22647,we will finish all this course,2
75480,very useful,2
81937,"the instructors are very knowledgeable, but the course seems to have the , ""we just threw this together at the last minute feel"". many of the quizzes are very poorly worded. the final project is a bit of a disaster as some of the reviewers are unable to unzip a generic '.gz' file and you can end up getting 0 points from those particular incompetent types.",0
21207,very useful course,2
42375,there are some incorrect answers in quizes and some instructions for the ssigments are qiute unclear...,1
8524,nice course for a starter.,2
32760,a must-take for every professional in the sustainability field.,2
93600,"overall not a bad course. needs some tidying up though. for example, the assignments seem to assume knowledge of functions not covered in the prior lessons. same applies to the textbook, e.g. page 50 refers to the subset() function, but it is not actually covered.",1
19459,excellent contents for concepts explained with sample queries and assignments. it is really amazing to go thru all the new concepts within such a short time frame.,2
23288,"this course provided me with some vital knowledge about health and nutrition, however, i consider it to be very short and rather shallow. the issues would require more coverage, than, with some weeks, 15 minutes for the whole week. another issue is the tests. 50 % margin for passing the exam seems too easy. the videos have great graphics and the issues are well explained. overaly 3/4 stars.",1
16049,so basic tableau explanations,1
19038,"i really appreciate the attempt of the course; what i got is that we should trust good research and that claims need to be proved. the problem though was the approach, in my opinion. i felt that someone was giving me the right answer for everything and i wasn't supposed to think about it all.i would rather focus my attention on the large gap between reality and ""scientific"" claims. the power of a cost-benefit analysis is enormous and it could be even broader with a personal interpretation and with a high level of awareness.well done with the aim of the course, just develop the approach impact.p.s the part with the guy that is apparently in asia is really chaotic and i couldn't follow that amount of short videos.",1
100148,"the information is probably great, but the instructor speaks way too slowly in the videos and it's very difficult to listen to. i switched to reading it as a transcript but that generates as a .txt file which is also very difficult to read as it's not broken into paragraphs.",0
66113,"excellent, thought-provoking course. i especially enjoyed the final week lectures that pulled it all together. both should be required listening for both voters and politicians in democracies.",2
90255,the course was very shallow as if teaching english literature,0
13875,very good introductory courses.,2
5643,"very practical introduction to bioinformatics tools from a biological perspective. labs were excellent, and the quizzes were mostly well-designed. only downside is that some required software/web tools are difficult to run on linux, but that's unavoidable given the field.",2

42346,good to start your study of leadership skills,2

56617,very basic and superficial course. apologies each time derivatives need to be used.,0
7333,"some lectures are just right for the public in general but most of them seem to be built from common sense, there´s where i wonder if the american people are so unliterate on food issues. the quality of the visual material is also variable, i am sure that including animation of more appealing graphics would be helpful to engage more people into the course; another challenge would be to prepare more challenging content.",0
100321,really useful!,2
6002,"so much of the content was limited without paying for the course, that calling it a mooc is a real stretch. because of these limitations, most of my work was done on my own, and by purchasing the related book. since my local community college used to run this course, but now points to this onine course instead, it's a huge disappointment. most folks who are going into business for themselves need good information but have little cash. the one star is for the handouts (i believe pulled from other websites but pointed to by this course) - these have been useful.",0
65136,"initially i thought this was a great course, but my optimism quickly dissipated. the homework assignments all required information that wasn't covered in the lectures, forcing hours of searching for answers. during the week, questions in the forums were answered within a day or so, but there was no help at all on the weekends. if i got stuck on a friday night and couldn't find an answer myself, i had to wait until monday to get a reply from an instructor or teaching assistant. for those who work during regular business hours and use their free time on the weekends to study, this course becomes nearly impossible to complete.",0
24439,"this course is rigourous, the quizzes are challenging. i hope they provide more practice quizzes",2
95461,"i have two general comments:the first comment is . . . there was too wide a gap between the lecture content and the assignments. the second comment i have is . . . i spent too much time trying to figure out what the autograder wanted and not enough time learning data science with python. i can only imagine the work that it takes to develop and launch a course like this. in all, i'm very excited to be part of this program. my comments are critical but hopefully helpful and all your work is appreciated.",1
95594,excellent course that helped my organisation ability improve immensely.,2
23618,"it is very basic and the principles are for a third-grader. after all the things said, at the end the first video was about pancakes (nvm they were gluten free)",0
83235,really excellent materials and links but spoiled by typos on the videos and in the quiz questions. i'm sure some of the quiz answers conflicted with what had been said in the videos.,0
104006,"first of all i expected something deeper. first of all this courser is less understandable than ""the swift programming language"" free book from apple. before i join the course i have read a few chapters and from my point of view book explains material much much better. the second point – it looks like tutors invent examples during the lesson (on the fly), this is bring a mess. and last thing about this course that tutors commit an gross error during lecture. please have a look at ""advanced swift"" lecture, i am talking about closures. the teacher said that closure captures the copy of outside variable, but this is completely wrong! closures capture the variable itself, not the variable value",0
17447,the assignments are challenging and fun to do. i feel like my writing has improved a lot!,2

13106,tobias is a nice teacher and he makes game theory looks like piece of cake.,2
16182,the lessons have been very helpful in preparing for a technical interview. highly recommended!,2
101610,"there is no instruction with this course. if you've never written a script before you're not going to get a lot of help here other than researching things yourself, which you can do without this course. not to mention, the feedback is minimal and not all that helpful. for example. if i've never written a script, what value am i to someone else who has also never written a script. and what value is their feedback to me. i signed up to get some experience and to also get feedback from those more experienced than i. i'm less interested in what my peers have to say and more interested in the feedback of the instructor who has years more experience than most of us. to pass assignments off of 4 or 5 peer reviews is worthless. there's no value in that. what does the instructor think??? would he pass us? he occasionally drops a line in the discussion forum, but no direct feedback to the students.i think this class should have a cap on enrollment so that the instructor can actually review and provide feedback to the students. joke's on anyone paying $49 to essentially teach yourself. this guys just sits back and ""moderates"" when he can.the best thing about this class is that it does force you to write, but beyond that, it's not helpful at all. truly disappointing.",0
14168,"some video explanations are not so clear, so will be great to highlight some concepts, theory and methods or technical (with some reading), also will be great exhibit the latest news about toolbox(that is the current topic) or data scientists",1

17305,"long, slow, rambling video. i watched most of it at 1.75x. slides are kind of a mess and lectures are disorganized.",1
26018,excellent course to learn unity3d!!! the hand on projects help a lot in learn the unity3d environment. i definitely recommend is class.,2
105014,compared to the first three courses in this specialization this course is very unstructured. the video's almost seem to scheduled randomly and a thread stringing everything together in a logical and purposeful way is completely missing. learning anything from this course - at least for me - is very hard.,0
24852,very interesting.,2
30688,"maybe, i missed the information about this course being focused towards non-native speakers. was this course focus to that target audience? as a native-english speaker, i found this course a bit easy. however, i enjoyed the refresher, and i will use this information in future courses. thank you!",2
81202,excellent course for fundamental of macroeconomics.,2
57325,"excellent, must course for everybody who want to take up machine learning as their career. it's an ultimate start.",2
91717,assignments were way too simplistic,1
62433,"i think the content was quite interesting; as someone new to marketing, i was really looking forward to the lectures and exercises. however, the content was simply too much for me to complete. it's a bit ironic that a course about marketing missed its market. to give a bit more detail: there were 12 video lectures, 3 assignments that had to be done days before the end of the week to be peer-reviewed, and then i had to peer review others work, while also going through all the assigned reading. it seemed more like a courseload for a full time student or perhaps a part-time student. as online students typically are neither, i'm surprised the course content wasn't better managed. i take a lot of notes, so perhaps that's what slowed me down, but i also have a full time job and i intern on the weekends. i was hoping this course could easily be done in the evening hours. other coursera courses provided an excellent balance of content and courseload, i'm disappointed that this course wasn't one of them. it seemed very useful and interesting.",0
32978,it is really a great start course for learning html. it is neat with practical examples.,2

94542,"better than stat inference, and gave some reasonable intuition, but could be improved i think by focussing on more understanding and less maths and formulas. some of it did seem to be - here' s a formula, plug the numbers in to get the quiz question right, whereas in reality (in the world of work) that question is completely unrealistic - you have raw data and you need to do the regression and understand what it means.",1
39125,a very good course!,2

82828,"the course tackles an interesting topic: why do we enjoy music?but there are two problems with this course:1) it fails to provide convincing evidence for its claims; the evidence is circumstantial and flimsy.2) the lecturer is, how shall i say this politely, monotonic. he lacks enthusiasm.my recommendation: if you are interested in the topic, take this course and make your own mind up. maybe it will convince you. if not, you will have learnt a bit about human perception a sound perception.",0
28294,i encourage this course because it has many exiting features and tasks.,2
18378,"the content was very useful, especially the lessons that focused on applying the scientific method to computer science. i liked the fact that most concepts were taught, and then reviewed again at the end of a video, solidifying what i learned. i did find the quality of the videos to be rather lacking. as someone who develops online courses for a living, i suggest using two cameras so that you can switch between two views when a cut is needed to prevent jumping or leaving mistakes in videos. the professors definitely seemed nervous, but i suppose that goes away with time. thank you for this awesome course!",2
99574,i was expecting an intro course for beginners... this was not it. i'd say this is more of a refresher course for intermediate/advanced users who are out of practice.,0
27174,"great insight into how everything works, what is important and how to code websites properly",2

62928,course could be better,1
101103,the whole course is nice and there were lot of new things to learn. i am not from an it background but still found it very useful. however the capstone was a bit of disappointment. i believe they should have included some teaching authority to check the capstone projects for my better understanding. the whole capstone is reviewed by peers which is great but as per certification i believe there should be some professional help too. i even tried to speak to someone over the phone but there was no number available. i ended up with chatting with some one on the help center but that was not very helpful either. the course content for operation analytics and people analytics were indeed very useful. thanks.,0

77280,"all of the review i've read were that the course was great, so maybe it is me that was the problem. however, as i would go through the written material, i would try to work the problems given as examples, and when they did not work, i was confused and wondered why the example given to teach us would not work. i asked for help a number of times, providing screen shots of the results i got trying to duplicate what the example was supposed to show, and page numbers of where the example was presented in the course materials. one former student basically said that i should not be trying to duplicate the examples, but just accept the concept they were trying to show. another did a good job of explaining one of my questions, but then all replies to my question ceased. i decide to drop out of the class and try teaching myself, as i have done on everything i have learned about computers since my 1st computer in 1983. i have been very impressed with other courses given by coursera members, but this one was not one of them. all of the other submissions praise the course, so maybe it is just me, but none of the other submissions mentioned any actual things the course had done - just that it was great.",1

103623,this course was way too basic. the instructor basically just gave us links to existing web content. very disappointed in the course. it felt like the instructor was lazy to develop a real curriculum.,0

26967,"absolutely not apropriate for very beginners. lacks explanation of ""why"" through all the videos, simply giving you information to remember ""if you do this, this will happen"". such a structure of explanations doesn't give freedom in the future to do something different, as you don't get a general understanding of what you do.additionally, all course is tought in mac. some commands are different for windows, and they were not even mentioned in the videos! i did not sign up for this course to be forced to spend hours in google, trying to find how to do something, that supposed to be explained in the lesson.overall, the course absolutely lacks attention to windows users and is not appropriate for absolute beginners.",0
40534,"the material is very interesting. there a a huge number of quizzes over poorly explained (or not at all explained) models, which would still be an interesting challenge if the models themselves had better explanations. this has been the most frustrating coursera class i have taken, not because of the subject difficulty, but because of the lack of adequate resources for working with the models.",0

98326,"some materials are useful but the teacher has no idea of teaching techniques and good presentation. very bad choice for the university of irvin, california to entrust such an interesting course to such an incompetent and feeble instructor. she is reading in a monotonous way and nothing more. her presentations have no meaning. she does not appear in the video lectures. she can not introduce animated elements. the materials she selected are sometimes and only somehow relevant. the most of the materials have only percentages, and small details on history. a course of poor quality.",0

22820,"it could be more elaborated. in the 3rd week, there was more equations and hurry to complete the topic, i think. but all in all good. it gives you a brief idea of finance.",1
86294,the content drags and can be boring,1
29297,"the three stars are because the parts actually giving information had value and i learned some interesting things. the 2 stars were removed because of the truly obnoxious plugging of the prof's own book and research project. he goes on and on about how fantastic it is how we can all participate in scientific research, but if i am supplying data, why do i have to pay for that privilege!? if it were really about the research he would want my data whether i paid for it or not. the course felt mostly like one big plug to make money. to make this course worthwhile you have fast forward a lot through the sales raps, which includes a few lectures in their entirety. it's also much better at twice speed, but most classes are. :)",1
66866,"interesting, broad introduction to the field. most of the lectures are easy enough to follow as someone with a psychology background.",2
65021,"overall i was disappointed with this course. in the end i don't think it was any better than any of the free online tutorials out there. the instructor spoke so quickly in the videos he was nearly incomprehensible. the explanations were incomplete at best and most of the time amounted to nothing more than ""type this... now type this."". i'm well aware that the only way to learn programming is by doing it yourself, but if i pay for a course i expect an explanation of how things work under the hood. i was looking forward to taking the entire ruby on rails specialization, now i'm not so sure.",0
95936,"i really like the course however it was too short and generic, and writing a memo as a repetation of the course was not that exhilarating...i haven´t used the discussion forums too much however i was expecting more on building business models...probably it will be the subject of the next package but still 3 courses were too little as coverage....i really liked the alagories and interviews from real life experiences and thank you for the effort...",0
99766,it's ok. reading the top three books on time management would take less time and provide far more insight and inspiration.,0

5866,"awesome course ,a must for any programmer.",2
89741,well thought out course. i learned a lot.some of the supplemental materials were extremely dense with professor-speak. i found my learning ground to a slow crawl from having to look up as many a 5 words in some sentences and i have a masters degree.in reading some of my peers essay submissions it seems that others may have had a similar difficulty with the material.,2
61294,"the course was really good. i've studied chinese in china for three years and i still learned so much from this course. i also got a lot of new vocabulary. things to improve: the conversations need to be louder, the teacher is sometimes standing in front of the words so they're hard to see, the grammar could use a little more explanation. overall, it's a good course. thanks to everyone who worked hard to make it happen!谢谢你们。",2

86302,"this course was not only enriching, but delighting. i genuinely mean when i say that it was a true delight. congratulations!",2
67626,"this course has great potential as it is an extraordinarily timely topic, domestically and globally. the accessible required reading assignments were thought provoking and topical. also, one of the required videos proved helpful, and a couple of the optional ted talks were ""must see's"" for anyone involved in the non-profit sector.it was problematic that there was so little direction with respect to how one might access the required reading materials that were not linked into the course syllabus. in fact, one of the links provided simply directed the learners to a youtube video, extolling the virtues of the book wherein the required chapter was located. another blatant colleague marketing technique occurred during the course of one of the required videos wherein the organizer interviewed an author about his book. (there was some helpful substantive information that came out of that interview, but for the most part, i felt as though i was watching an infomercial.) requests for help fell on deaf ears, except for those of co-learners.a small, but annoying, flaw was that the professors were simply reading text from their slides, for the video component of the course--with an additional word thrown in, on occasion, for good measure. it would have been less distracting just to have the slides to read.i wish this course had been designed and taught to the standards i have come to expect from coursera courses. it could have been one of the most valuable yet.",0

2201,"the video instruction are not as helpful as i wished. they were too brief, and all the learning end up with doing the exercises. the regular exercises and the quizzes use different database system, and it sometimes hard to transfer what you learn to the quizzes.the pre-quiz exercises are more helpful imo, but no answer key is provided. sometimes i am still confused even after passing the quiz.",1

33023,i loved it so much.collen is a good lecturer and all she said i understood.,2
90155,"the topic is interesting and the lectures itself were good. the explanations of the algorithms and concepts was clear and easy to understand. however, the amount of material covered is very little. i think there should either be more concepts thought or they should be covered in more depth.quizzes: the quizzes were very weak. they didn't really tell you weather you understood the concept or not. if one of the answers was wrong there was no information which one it was. so you have no idea which lecture you should watch again.assignments: the assignments were very bad prepared. in some assignments there were bugs in the provided code, we weren't supposed to edit. the assignments itself are rather easy and can be completed quite quickly, if there wasn't the grader. from the grading you got no information what was wrong or which tests passed or failed. most of the time it wasn't the case that the algorithm failed, instead the output was not as expected by the grader, although it was as described in the assignment. but you never knew. this part has to be improved a lot.overall i have to say that i expected much more from university of pennsylvania, especially after taking the first part of the specialization which was of good quality.",0

13824,"the material isn't bad, and it does provide some interesting prompts to think and write about. but, the curriculum is not at all creative. it focuses on easily teachable and repeatable lessons that teach a certain, standard way of doing things. it tries to reduce creative writing down to a formula instead of acknowledging that many compelling and successful stories can have almost any imaginable form. if perhaps many types of structures had been emphasized or structures had been pointed out as optional, this would have been mitigated, but the time period is so short that there's no time. the result is a class that feels more like ""writing: how to make a formulaic, sellable book"" than anything with ""creative"" in the title.",0
